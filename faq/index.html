          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Bitcoin family office?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Bitcoin family office is a private advisory and administrative structure that manages the full spectrum of wealth-related decisions for families with significant Bitcoin holdings — including custody architecture, estate planning, tax strategy, succession planning, heir education, and governance. It applies the rigorous, institutional disciplines of a traditional family office to the unique technical and legal properties of Bitcoin."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How is a Bitcoin family office different from a traditional family office?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Traditional family offices manage diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity. Bitcoin introduces technical complexities most traditional advisors are not equipped to handle: self-custody, seed phrase management, multisig arrangements, digital asset estate law (RUFADAA), and the absence of a custodian to recover access after death. A Bitcoin family office integrates these technical realities into every planning function."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Who needs a Bitcoin family office?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Anyone with Bitcoin holdings that represent a material portion of their net worth — typically 5 BTC or more — benefits from a family office approach. The threshold is not an absolute number but rather the point at which an unplanned event (death, incapacity, legal dispute) would cause irreversible financial harm to the holder or their family."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How much Bitcoin do you need to justify a family office approach?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As a practical guide: holders with under 1 BTC primarily need basic custody and a simple estate plan. Holders with 1–10 BTC need formal estate documents and a Letter of Instruction. Holders with 10–100 BTC benefit from trust structures, tax planning, and professional coordination. Holders above 100 BTC warrant comprehensive family office architecture."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What services does a Bitcoin family office provide?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Core services include custody architecture design, estate and succession planning, trust structure analysis and formation, tax strategy and optimization, heir education, family governance frameworks, investment policy statements, and ongoing monitoring of legal and regulatory developments."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can an existing family office handle Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most traditional family offices lack the technical competency to manage Bitcoin custody, digital asset estate documents, and multisig governance. Verify whether your existing family office understands hardware wallets, seed phrase inheritance protocols, RUFADAA, and directed trust structures."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What does it cost to set up a Bitcoin family office structure?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A basic structure — revocable trust with Bitcoin provisions, Letter of Instruction, and documented custody — typically costs $3,000–$10,000 in attorney fees. Comprehensive structures including irrevocable trusts, GRAT planning, and coordinated tax strategy may range from $15,000–$50,000 or more. The cost is almost always small relative to the estate planning risk being mitigated."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What happens to my Bitcoin when I die?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Without planning, your Bitcoin may be permanently inaccessible. Bitcoin has no customer service department and no institution to call. Access requires either the seed phrase or private keys. If no one knows where the seed phrase is — or how to use it — the Bitcoin is effectively lost forever. Proper planning documents the custody arrangement and provides your executor or successor trustee with the authority and information needed to access the estate."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a will to pass Bitcoin to heirs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A will alone is insufficient and potentially dangerous for Bitcoin. Wills become public record in probate, and listing seed phrases or wallet locations in a will is a catastrophic security risk. Bitcoin requires a Letter of Instruction (a private, non-probated document), properly drafted trust documents, and executor/trustee training."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can Bitcoin be included in a revocable living trust?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Bitcoin can be titled to a revocable living trust, which allows it to pass to heirs without probate. The trust documents must include explicit digital asset language, and the Letter of Instruction should describe the custody arrangement. Do not list seed phrases in trust documents."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is RUFADAA and why does it matter for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"RUFADAA (the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act) governs whether your executor, trustee, or power-of-attorney agent has legal authority to access your digital assets. Adopted in 47+ states, it allows fiduciaries to manage, access, and distribute digital assets — including Bitcoin — under defined conditions. Without RUFADAA authority in your estate documents, your executor may lack the legal standing to access your Bitcoin."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Does my estate attorney need to understand Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. An attorney who doesn't understand Bitcoin custody may give dangerous advice: suggesting seed phrases go in the will, treating Bitcoin like a bank account, or failing to include RUFADAA provisions. Ask prospective attorneys: What is a hardware wallet? What is multisig? What does RUFADAA provide? What should NOT go in a will regarding Bitcoin?"}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What are the biggest estate planning mistakes Bitcoin holders make?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The five most common: (1) No estate plan at all. (2) Estate plan not updated after acquiring new wallets or changing custody. (3) Seed phrases stored in a will or digital document accessible to others. (4) No Letter of Instruction — executor has no idea where or how to access the Bitcoin. (5) Naming a trustee or executor who lacks Bitcoin technical knowledge."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Bitcoin Letter of Instruction?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Letter of Instruction (LOI) is a private, non-legal document that guides your executor, successor trustee, or designated family member through accessing your Bitcoin. It describes where hardware wallets are physically located, what exchange accounts exist, the structure of any multisig setup, key contacts, and special instructions. It does NOT contain seed phrases — it references where seed phrases are securely stored."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I document my Bitcoin holdings for estate planning purposes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Create and maintain: (1) An inventory of all wallets and exchange accounts. (2) A Letter of Instruction describing custody structure. (3) A documented cost basis record for each acquisition. (4) A record of the trust or entity that owns each holding. Review and update this documentation annually and after any major change."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can my executor access my Bitcoin without my seed phrase?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not in any legitimate way. Bitcoin custody is controlled by private keys derived from the seed phrase. Without the seed phrase, there is no legal override, no customer support escalation, and no court order that can compel access. This is why the Letter of Instruction and secure seed phrase storage are critical estate planning tools."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What happens to Bitcoin in probate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin can pass through probate like other property — but probate is public, slow, and expensive. More importantly, a probate court cannot compel access to Bitcoin without the seed phrase. If Bitcoin is held in a revocable living trust, it bypasses probate entirely. For Bitcoin, avoiding probate is even more important than for traditional assets."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What type of trust is best for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The right trust structure depends on your goals. A revocable living trust is the minimum for probate avoidance. For estate tax planning, irrevocable trusts (GRATs, SLATs, dynasty trusts) offer significant advantages. For multi-generational Bitcoin wealth, a dynasty trust in Wyoming or South Dakota is the gold standard: perpetual duration, no state income tax on trust income, strong asset protection, and specific digital asset statutory authority."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a dynasty trust and why is it used for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A dynasty trust is an irrevocable trust designed to last multiple generations — often perpetually. Bitcoin is well-suited for dynasty trust holding because: Bitcoin's scarcity model is inherently long-term; dynasty trusts can hold Bitcoin for 100+ years with no forced distribution or estate tax at each generation; Wyoming and South Dakota have abolished the rule against perpetuities; directed trust structures allow a Bitcoin-literate co-trustee to handle custody."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Why do so many Bitcoin families choose Wyoming for their trust?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Wyoming has enacted specific digital asset trust statutes, abolished the rule against perpetuities (allowing perpetual dynasty trusts), has no state income tax on trust income, offers strong Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT) laws, and allows directed trust structures that separate investment decisions from administrative responsibilities."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I set up a Wyoming trust if I don't live in Wyoming?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Trust situs does not have to match your state of residence. Many people who live in high-tax or less favorable states — California, New York, Oregon, Massachusetts — establish Wyoming or South Dakota trusts. The trust must have a Wyoming-connected trustee, but the beneficiaries and grantor can live anywhere."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a directed trust and why does it matter for Bitcoin custody?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A directed trust separates the investment function from the administrative function. A distribution trustee handles custody and investment decisions for the Bitcoin; a corporate trustee handles administration. This matters for Bitcoin because most corporate trustees lack Bitcoin custody competency. A directed trust allows a Bitcoin-competent co-trustee to control the actual keys while the corporate trustee provides legal and administrative infrastructure."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between a revocable and irrevocable trust for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A revocable trust can be changed by the grantor at any time. It provides probate avoidance but does not remove assets from your taxable estate. An irrevocable trust cannot be changed after formation. It removes assets and future appreciation from your taxable estate, provides asset protection, and enables estate tax planning strategies. For large Bitcoin holdings, irrevocable trust structures provide the most significant long-term benefits."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a DAPT and does it work for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT) is a self-settled irrevocable trust in which the grantor can be a discretionary beneficiary while shielding trust assets from most creditor claims. Wyoming, South Dakota, Nevada, and Alaska have strong DAPT statutes. For Bitcoin, a DAPT can protect assets from future creditors while retaining the ability to benefit from the trust, subject to fraudulent transfer limitations."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Should I put my Bitcoin in an LLC or a trust?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on your goals. An LLC offers operating flexibility, liability protection, and basis-step-up planning options. A trust offers probate avoidance, succession planning, and estate tax reduction. Many sophisticated Bitcoin families use both: Bitcoin held in a family LLC, with the LLC interest held in a trust. This layered structure combines the operating flexibility of an entity with the succession and tax benefits of trust ownership."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Does the federal estate tax apply to Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Bitcoin is treated as property by the IRS (Notice 2014-21). Property above the federal estate tax exemption is subject to federal estate tax at a 40% rate. The exemption was $13.61M per person under TCJA provisions. 2025 legislation may have changed the applicable exemption — verify current amounts with your estate attorney."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the current federal estate tax exemption?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The pre-2025 exemption under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was approximately $13.61M per person ($27.22M for married couples). 2025 tax legislation may have extended, modified, or made permanent these amounts. Do not rely on pre-legislation figures without confirming with your estate attorney that they reflect current law applicable to your situation."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Which states have estate taxes on Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"States imposing a state estate tax include: Connecticut ($12.92M exemption), Hawaii ($5.49M), Illinois ($4M), Massachusetts ($2M), Maryland ($5M), Maine ($6.41M), Minnesota ($3M), New York ($7.16M — cliff rule), Oregon ($1M — lowest in US), Rhode Island ($1.77M), Vermont ($5M), Washington state ($2.193M), and Washington D.C. ($4.528M). All other states have no state estate tax."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What states have inheritance taxes on Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"States with inheritance taxes: Iowa (fully repealed as of January 1, 2025), Kentucky (4–16%, children and spouses exempt), Maryland (10%, spouses exempt), Nebraska (1–18% by relationship), New Jersey (up to 16% for Class C/D beneficiaries, children and spouses exempt), Pennsylvania (0–15% by relationship — spouses 0%, lineal descendants 4.5%, siblings 12%, others 15%)."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Bitcoin GRAT and how does it reduce estate taxes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) is funded with Bitcoin. The grantor receives annuity payments back over a defined term. Any appreciation above the IRS Section 7520 hurdle rate passes to beneficiaries estate- and gift-tax free. Because Bitcoin has historically appreciated far beyond the hurdle rate, GRATs can transfer enormous value out of a taxable estate with minimal gift tax cost."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a SLAT and can it hold Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT) is an irrevocable trust where your spouse is a discretionary beneficiary. Funding it with Bitcoin removes that Bitcoin from your taxable estate while preserving your family's indirect access through your spouse. It is one of the most efficient structures for married couples with large Bitcoin holdings. Limitation: if you divorce or your spouse predeceases you, the access benefit is lost."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Does gifting Bitcoin use my lifetime exemption?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Gifting Bitcoin above the annual exclusion amount uses your lifetime gift/estate tax exemption. Each use is reported on Form 709. No tax is due until cumulative lifetime gifts exceed the applicable exemption. Importantly, gifts of appreciated Bitcoin carry over the donor's cost basis to the recipient — no step-up. This is the critical trade-off between gifting (no step-up) and inheritance (step-up at death)."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the annual gift tax exclusion for Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The annual exclusion (indexed for inflation) was $18,000 per recipient per year in 2024. Married couples can gift-split to double it to $36,000 per recipient. These gifts do not use the lifetime exemption and do not require a Form 709 filing. For Bitcoin holders with many potential recipients, systematic annual gifting transfers value without gift tax consequences."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the safest way to store Bitcoin for estate planning purposes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A hardware wallet with a properly documented, securely stored seed phrase is the foundation. For estate purposes, multi-signature custody is the gold standard: typically a 2-of-3 arrangement where three keys are held by different parties and any two can authorize transactions. This eliminates single-point-of-failure while maintaining family control."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is multisig and why do family offices use it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Multi-signature (multisig) custody requires multiple private keys to authorize any transaction — for example, 2 out of 3 keys. No single key can move the Bitcoin alone. For family offices, multisig provides: protection against theft, protection against loss, institutional-grade security, and succession planning capabilities."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can a corporate trustee hold Bitcoin in multisig custody?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Some institutional trustees are building Bitcoin custody capability, but most currently lack technical infrastructure for self-custody Bitcoin. The directed trust structure solves this: a Bitcoin-competent investment co-trustee holds the custody keys while the corporate trustee handles administrative functions."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What happens to hardware wallets in an estate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys — but the device itself is not the Bitcoin. The seed phrase (typically 12 or 24 words) is the real access. Hardware wallets can be lost or destroyed without losing the Bitcoin, as long as the seed phrase is secure and accessible. Your estate plan must document where each hardware wallet is and where the corresponding seed phrase is stored."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Should I store seed phrases in my will?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely not. Wills become public record in probate. Listing a seed phrase in a will exposes it to anyone who searches public records — effectively publishing the private key to your Bitcoin. Seed phrases should be stored physically (metal backup, paper in a fireproof safe), securely, and separately from the hardware wallet."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a geographic key distribution strategy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For multisig setups, geographic distribution means storing keys in physically separate locations — for example, one key at your primary residence, one in a bank safe deposit box in a different city, and one held by a trusted professional custodian. This protects against natural disasters, theft, and regional disruptions."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How should I document my custody setup for heirs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use a Bitcoin Letter of Instruction to document: each wallet's location and what it holds, the type of custody (single-key, multisig, exchange), where seed phrases are stored, contact information for custody co-trustees or professional custodians, and any special instructions for accessing multisig arrangements. Never write the seed phrase itself in any document."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between hot and cold custody?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hot custody means Bitcoin is on a device connected to the internet — such as an exchange account or software wallet. Cold custody means private keys are stored on an air-gapped hardware wallet that has never connected to the internet. Cold custody is strongly preferred for significant holdings. Exchange accounts are subject to custodian insolvency, regulatory seizure, or access denial at death."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the step-up in basis for inherited Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Under current U.S. tax law, inherited property receives a step-up in cost basis to its fair market value at the date of death. For Bitcoin: if you paid $10,000 for 1 BTC that is worth $95,000 at your death, your heir's cost basis is $95,000. If they sell at $95,000, they owe zero capital gains tax. This step-up eliminates decades of embedded capital gains for heirs."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Does the wash sale rule apply to Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As of current law, the wash sale rule does not apply to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is classified as property, not a security. This means Bitcoin holders can sell at a loss to realize the tax benefit, then immediately repurchase, without the 30-day waiting period required for stocks. Note: there is ongoing legislative discussion about extending wash sale rules to digital assets."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the most tax-efficient way to pass Bitcoin to heirs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Holding Bitcoin until death (for the step-up in basis) is often the most tax-efficient transfer for capital gains. For estate tax purposes, transferring appreciated Bitcoin to a GRAT or dynasty trust removes future appreciation from the estate without triggering capital gains at the time of transfer. The optimal strategy requires coordination between your estate attorney and CPA."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I donate Bitcoin to charity and get a deduction?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Donating Bitcoin held more than one year directly to a qualified charity provides a charitable deduction for the full fair market value, with no capital gains recognition. This is significantly more tax-efficient than selling Bitcoin and donating the cash. Consult your CPA to confirm current deduction limits."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Bitcoin Charitable Remainder Trust?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A CRT is an irrevocable trust funded with appreciated Bitcoin. The charity sells the Bitcoin without capital gains recognition. You receive an income stream for life or a term of years. At death, the remainder passes to charity. You receive a partial charitable deduction in the year of contribution. CRTs are best suited for Bitcoin holders with highly appreciated positions and philanthropic intent."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How does Bitcoin mining affect my estate taxes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Mining income is ordinary income at receipt. Mined Bitcoin has a cost basis equal to fair market value when mined. Mining equipment can be depreciated with bonus depreciation rules potentially applying. Mining through a properly structured entity can create tax benefits while accumulating Bitcoin. The Abundant Mines team has compiled an extensive analysis of Bitcoin mining tax strategies at abundantmines.com/tax-strategy/."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is cost basis and why does it matter?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cost basis is the amount you paid for your Bitcoin (plus any fees). When you sell or transfer Bitcoin, your taxable gain is the sale price minus your cost basis. Accurate basis tracking matters for calculating capital gains tax, optimizing which specific coins to sell (HIFO minimizes gains), estate planning analysis, and gift planning."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I prepare my heirs to receive Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Start with education: heirs need to understand what Bitcoin is, why it holds value, and how custody works — before they inherit. Then establish structures: a clear Letter of Instruction, trust documents with successor trustee provisions, and documented custody arrangements. Practice: walk your successor through the signing process while you are alive."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What should I tell my children about inheriting Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The most important conversations: where the Bitcoin is and how it is stored, why you hold Bitcoin (so they understand the thesis), what NOT to do immediately after inheriting (don't move funds until consulting an estate attorney and CPA), where to find qualified help, and what Bitcoin inheritance scams look like."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What documents should my executor have to access my Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your executor or successor trustee needs: legal authority (trust documents or letters testamentary), the Letter of Instruction describing custody arrangement and where seed phrases are stored, your contact list (estate attorney, CPA, Bitcoin custody advisor), and enough technical knowledge or a trusted Bitcoin-competent contact to guide them."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do in the first 30 days after inheriting Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Days 1–7: secure physical hardware, do NOT move funds, contact the estate attorney. Days 8–14: establish legal authority, locate the Letter of Instruction. Days 15–30: engage a Bitcoin-literate CPA before any sale or transfer, document everything. The most important rule: slow down. Moving Bitcoin before legal authority is established can create significant problems."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I protect my heirs from Bitcoin inheritance scams?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Educate them in advance. Key facts: legitimate Bitcoin recovery services don't exist. Seed phrases should never be shared with anyone. Urgency pressure is the primary scam tactic. A 48-hour verification rule applies to anyone claiming to be a professional — if they won't wait for verification, they are not legitimate."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can minors inherit Bitcoin directly?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Minors cannot legally own property directly in most jurisdictions. Options: (1) A custodial account under UGMA/UTMA, controlled by an adult until the minor reaches majority. (2) A trust holding the Bitcoin for the minor's benefit. For significant Bitcoin holdings, a properly structured trust with defined distribution ages (25, 30, 35) is strongly preferred over UGMA accounts."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I find a Bitcoin-literate estate attorney?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ask prospective attorneys: What is a hardware wallet? What is multisig? What is RUFADAA and what does it provide? What should NOT be included in a will regarding Bitcoin? What trust jurisdiction would you recommend for a client with significant Bitcoin holdings? If they cannot answer these fluently, they lack the technical competency to advise you."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What should I ask an estate attorney before hiring them for Bitcoin planning?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Essential questions: Have you drafted estate plans that specifically address Bitcoin custody? Do you understand the difference between a seed phrase and a private key? Have you worked with multisig setups? Do you know what RUFADAA provides? Which trust jurisdictions do you recommend for Bitcoin and why? What is your view on directed trusts for Bitcoin custody?"}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Does my CPA need to understand Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, significantly. Bitcoin tax reporting requires understanding property vs. security classification, HIFO and FIFO cost basis methods, the wash sale rule non-applicability, Form 8949 reporting requirements, mining income and deduction rules, charitable donation mechanics, and gift and estate tax implications. A CPA without this knowledge will file incorrect returns and miss significant planning opportunities."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What is The Bitcoin Family Office and what does it offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Bitcoin Family Office provides strategic education, planning frameworks, and advisory services for high-net-worth Bitcoin holders and their families. Our content covers every aspect of Bitcoin estate planning, custody architecture, tax strategy, trust structures, and heir education. For families ready for personalized advisory work, we maintain a selective waitlist."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How much does Bitcoin estate planning typically cost?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Basic estate plan with Bitcoin provisions (revocable trust, POA, advance directive, Letter of Instruction): $3,000–$10,000. Complex irrevocable trust structures (dynasty trust, GRAT, SLAT): $15,000–$50,000+. Multisig custody setup with professional co-trustee: $2,000–$10,000 setup + annual fees. Comprehensive family office engagement: $25,000–$100,000+ annually for very large holdings."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How often should I review my Bitcoin estate plan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"At minimum: annually. Additionally, review after any of these events: significant change in Bitcoin price, acquisition of new wallets or change in custody setup, change in family structure, move to a different state, significant change in federal or state estate/gift tax law, or a change in the professionals managing your plan. Estate plans that are not reviewed regularly become dangerously outdated."}}

      <h2>What Is a Bitcoin Family Office?</h2>
      <span class="cat-badge">7 questions</span>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is a Bitcoin family office?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A Bitcoin family office is a private advisory and administrative structure that manages the full spectrum of wealth-related decisions for families with significant Bitcoin holdings — including custody architecture, estate planning, tax strategy, succession planning, heir education, and governance. It applies the rigorous, institutional disciplines of a traditional family office to the unique technical and legal properties of Bitcoin.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">How is a Bitcoin family office different from a traditional family office?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Traditional family offices are built around managing diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity. Bitcoin introduces technical complexities most traditional advisors are not equipped to handle: self-custody, seed phrase management, multisig arrangements, digital asset estate law (RUFADAA), and the absence of a custodian to recover access after death. A Bitcoin family office integrates these technical realities into every planning function.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Who needs a Bitcoin family office?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Anyone with Bitcoin holdings that represent a material portion of their net worth — typically 5 BTC or more — benefits from a family office approach. The threshold is not an absolute number but rather the point at which an unplanned event (death, incapacity, legal dispute) would cause irreversible financial harm to the holder or their family.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">How much Bitcoin do you need to justify a family office approach?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>As a practical guide: holders with under 1 BTC primarily need basic custody and a simple estate plan. Holders with 1–10 BTC need formal estate documents and a Letter of Instruction. Holders with 10–100 BTC benefit from trust structures, tax planning, and professional coordination. Holders above 100 BTC warrant comprehensive family office architecture.</p></div>
    </div>

      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What services does a Bitcoin family office provide?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Core services include custody architecture design, estate and succession planning, trust structure analysis and formation (working with qualified attorneys), tax strategy and optimization (with a Bitcoin-literate CPA), heir education, family governance frameworks, investment policy statements, and ongoing monitoring of legal and regulatory developments.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Can an existing family office handle Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Most traditional family offices lack the technical competency to manage Bitcoin custody, digital asset estate documents, and multisig governance. Some are actively building this capability. The safest approach: verify whether your existing family office understands hardware wallets, seed phrase inheritance protocols, RUFADAA, and directed trust structures. Most currently do not.</p></div>

      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What does it cost to set up a Bitcoin family office structure?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Cost depends on complexity. A basic structure — revocable trust with Bitcoin provisions, Letter of Instruction, and documented custody — typically costs $3,000–$10,000 in attorney fees. Comprehensive structures including irrevocable trusts, GRAT planning, and coordinated tax strategy may range from $15,000–$50,000 or more in professional fees. Ongoing administration adds annual costs. The cost is almost always small relative to the estate planning risk being mitigated.</p></div>

      <h2>Bitcoin Estate Planning Basics</h2>
      <span class="cat-badge">10 questions</span>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What happens to my Bitcoin when I die?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Without planning, your Bitcoin may be permanently inaccessible. Unlike bank accounts, Bitcoin has no customer service department and no institution to call. Access requires either the seed phrase or private keys. If no one knows where the seed phrase is — or how to use it — the Bitcoin is effectively lost forever. Proper planning documents the custody arrangement and provides your executor or successor trustee with the authority and information needed to access the estate.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Do I need a will to pass Bitcoin to heirs?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A will alone is insufficient and potentially dangerous for Bitcoin. Wills become public record in probate, and listing seed phrases or wallet locations in a will is a catastrophic security risk. Bitcoin requires a Letter of Instruction (a private, non-probated document), properly drafted trust documents, and executor/trustee training. The goal is to give your designated person legal authority and practical knowledge — without exposing sensitive information publicly.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Can Bitcoin be included in a revocable living trust?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Bitcoin can be titled to a revocable living trust, which allows it to pass to heirs without probate. The trust documents must include explicit digital asset language, and the Letter of Instruction should describe the custody arrangement. Importantly: do not list seed phrases in trust documents. The trust references the Bitcoin; the seed phrase location is documented separately in the <a href="/tools/bitcoin-letter-of-instruction">Letter of Instruction</a>.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is RUFADAA and why does it matter for Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>RUFADAA (the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act) governs whether your executor, trustee, or power-of-attorney agent has legal authority to access your digital assets. Adopted in 47+ states, it allows fiduciaries to manage, access, and distribute digital assets — including Bitcoin — under defined conditions. Without RUFADAA authority in your estate documents, your executor may lack the legal standing to even attempt to access your Bitcoin.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Does my estate attorney need to understand Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes — significantly. An attorney who doesn't understand Bitcoin custody may give dangerous advice: suggesting seed phrases go in the will (never do this), treating Bitcoin like a bank account, or failing to include RUFADAA provisions. Ask prospective attorneys: What is a hardware wallet? What is multisig? What does RUFADAA provide? What should NOT go in a will regarding Bitcoin? Correct answers to these questions indicate sufficient competency.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What are the biggest estate planning mistakes Bitcoin holders make?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>The five most common: (1) No estate plan at all. (2) Estate plan not updated after acquiring new wallets or changing custody. (3) Seed phrases stored in a will or digital document accessible to others. (4) No Letter of Instruction — executor has no idea where or how to access the Bitcoin. (5) Naming a trustee or executor who lacks Bitcoin technical knowledge and has no plan for how to access the estate.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is a Bitcoin Letter of Instruction?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A Letter of Instruction (LOI) is a private, non-legal document that guides your executor, successor trustee, or designated family member through accessing your Bitcoin after your death or incapacity. It describes where hardware wallets are physically located, what exchange accounts exist, the general structure of any multisig setup, key contacts, and special instructions. It does NOT contain seed phrases — it references where seed phrases are securely stored. <a href="/tools/bitcoin-letter-of-instruction">Build yours with our Letter of Instruction Builder →</a></p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">How do I document my Bitcoin holdings for estate planning purposes?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Create and maintain: (1) An inventory of all wallets and exchange accounts — not seed phrases, just account existence. (2) A Letter of Instruction describing custody structure and where to find access documentation. (3) A documented cost basis record for each acquisition (date, amount, price paid) for tax purposes. (4) A record of the trust or entity that owns each holding. Review and update this documentation annually and after any major change to your holdings or custody setup.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Can my executor access my Bitcoin without my seed phrase?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Not in any legitimate way. Bitcoin custody is controlled by private keys derived from the seed phrase. Without the seed phrase (or the private keys themselves), there is no legal override, no customer support escalation, and no court order that can compel access. This is why the Letter of Instruction and secure seed phrase storage are critical — your executor needs both legal authority (from your estate documents) and practical access (from your documented custody setup).</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What happens to Bitcoin in probate?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Bitcoin can pass through probate like other property — but probate is public, slow, and expensive. More importantly, a probate court cannot compel access to Bitcoin without the seed phrase. If Bitcoin is held in a revocable living trust, it bypasses probate entirely. For Bitcoin, avoiding probate is even more important than for traditional assets, because the access mechanics require privacy and cannot be handled by a court-supervised process.</p></div>

      <h2>Trusts and Legal Structures</h2>
      <span class="cat-badge">8 questions</span>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What type of trust is best for Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>The right trust structure depends on your goals. A revocable living trust is the minimum: it avoids probate and provides successor trustee access. For estate tax planning, irrevocable trusts (GRATs, SLATs, dynasty trusts) offer significant advantages. For multi-generational Bitcoin wealth, a dynasty trust in Wyoming or South Dakota is the gold standard: perpetual duration, no state income tax on trust income, strong asset protection, and specific digital asset statutory authority.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is a dynasty trust and why is it used for Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A dynasty trust is an irrevocable trust designed to last multiple generations — often perpetually. Bitcoin is particularly well-suited because: Bitcoin's scarcity model is inherently long-term; dynasty trusts can hold Bitcoin for 100+ years with no forced distribution or estate tax at each generation; Wyoming and South Dakota have abolished the rule against perpetuities; and directed trust structures allow a Bitcoin-literate co-trustee to handle custody while a corporate trustee handles administration.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Why do so many Bitcoin families choose Wyoming for their trust?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Wyoming has enacted specific digital asset trust statutes (Wyoming Statute § 34-29-101), abolished the rule against perpetuities (allowing perpetual dynasty trusts), has no state income tax on trust income, offers strong Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT) laws, and allows directed trust structures that separate investment decisions from administrative responsibilities. Wyoming has positioned itself as the most Bitcoin-friendly trust jurisdiction in the United States.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Can I set up a Wyoming trust if I don't live in Wyoming?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Trust situs (the governing jurisdiction) does not have to match your state of residence. Many people who live in high-tax states — California, New York, Oregon, Massachusetts — establish Wyoming or South Dakota trusts for the advantages those jurisdictions offer. The trust must have a Wyoming-connected trustee, but the beneficiaries and grantor can live anywhere.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is a directed trust and why does it matter for Bitcoin custody?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A directed trust separates the investment function from the administrative function. A "distribution trustee" handles custody and investment decisions for the Bitcoin; a "corporate trustee" handles administration, record-keeping, and regulatory compliance. This matters for Bitcoin because most corporate trustees lack Bitcoin custody competency. A directed trust allows a Bitcoin-competent co-trustee to control the actual keys and custody, while the corporate trustee provides legal and administrative infrastructure.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is the difference between a revocable and irrevocable trust for Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A revocable trust can be changed or dissolved by the grantor at any time. It provides probate avoidance and succession planning but does not remove assets from your taxable estate. An irrevocable trust cannot be changed after formation. It removes assets and future appreciation from your taxable estate, provides asset protection, and enables estate tax planning strategies. For large Bitcoin holdings, irrevocable trust structures provide the most significant long-term benefits — but changes after formation are extremely difficult.</p></div>

      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT) is a self-settled irrevocable trust in which the grantor can be a discretionary beneficiary, while shielding trust assets from most creditor claims. Wyoming, South Dakota, Nevada, and Alaska have strong DAPT statutes. For Bitcoin, a DAPT can protect assets from future creditors (subject to fraudulent transfer limitations) while retaining the ability to benefit from the trust. Effectiveness varies by state and circumstances; consult a qualified attorney.</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>It depends on your goals. An LLC offers operating flexibility, liability protection, and basis-step-up planning options. A trust offers probate avoidance, succession planning, and (for irrevocable trusts) estate tax reduction. Many sophisticated Bitcoin families use both: Bitcoin held in a family LLC, with the LLC interest held in a trust. This layered structure combines the operating flexibility of an entity with the succession and tax benefits of trust ownership.</p></div>

        <span class="q-text">Does the federal estate tax apply to Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Bitcoin is treated as property by the IRS (Notice 2014-21). Property above the federal estate tax exemption is subject to federal estate tax at a 40% rate. The exemption was $13.61M per person under TCJA provisions. 2025 legislation may have changed the applicable exemption — verify current amounts with your estate attorney. For Bitcoin holders with significant positions, estate tax planning is critical because Bitcoin's appreciation compounds the exposure each year.</p></div>

      <div class="faq-answer"><p>The pre-2025 exemption under TCJA was approximately $13.61M per person ($27.22M for married couples). 2025 tax legislation may have extended, modified, or made permanent these amounts. Do not rely on pre-legislation figures without confirming with your estate attorney that they reflect current law applicable to your situation.

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Inheritance tax is paid by heirs (not the estate). States with inheritance taxes: Iowa (fully repealed as of January 1, 2025), Kentucky (4–16%, children and spouses exempt), Maryland (10%, spouses exempt), Nebraska (1–18% by relationship), New Jersey (up to 16% for Class C/D beneficiaries, children and spouses exempt), Pennsylvania (0–15% by relationship — spouses 0%, lineal descendants 4.5%, siblings 12%, others 15%).</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) is funded with Bitcoin. The grantor receives annuity payments back over a defined term. Any appreciation above the IRS Section 7520 hurdle rate passes to beneficiaries estate- and gift-tax free. Because Bitcoin has historically appreciated far beyond the hurdle rate, GRATs can transfer enormous value out of a taxable estate with minimal gift tax cost.

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT) is an irrevocable trust where your spouse is a discretionary beneficiary. Funding it with Bitcoin removes that Bitcoin from your taxable estate while preserving your family's indirect access through your spouse. It is one of the most efficient structures for married couples with large Bitcoin holdings. Limitation: if you divorce or your spouse predeceases you, the access benefit is lost.</p></div>

        <span class="q-text">Does gifting Bitcoin use my lifetime exemption?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Gifting Bitcoin above the annual exclusion amount uses your lifetime gift/estate tax exemption. Each use is reported on Form 709. No tax is due until cumulative lifetime gifts exceed the applicable exemption. Importantly, gifts of appreciated Bitcoin carry over the donor's cost basis to the recipient — no step-up. This is the critical trade-off between gifting (no step-up) and inheritance (step-up at death).</p></div>

        <span class="q-text">What is the annual gift tax exclusion for Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>The annual exclusion was $18,000 per recipient per year in 2024 (indexed for inflation — verify current year amount with your CPA). Married couples can gift-split to double the exclusion to $36,000 per recipient. These gifts do not use the lifetime exemption and do not require a Form 709 filing. For Bitcoin holders with many potential recipients, systematic annual gifting is a simple and effective strategy to transfer value without gift tax consequences.</p></div>

      <h2>Bitcoin Custody and Security</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is the safest way to store Bitcoin for estate planning purposes?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A hardware wallet with a properly documented, securely stored seed phrase is the foundation. For estate purposes, multi-signature custody is the gold standard: typically a 2-of-3 arrangement where three keys are held by different parties (you, a trusted family member, and a professional custodian), and any two can authorize transactions. This eliminates single-point-of-failure while maintaining family control.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is multisig and why do family offices use it?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Multi-signature (multisig) custody requires multiple private keys to authorize any transaction — for example, 2 out of 3 keys. No single key can move the Bitcoin alone. For family offices, multisig provides: protection against theft (one compromised key is insufficient), protection against loss (one lost key can be replaced), institutional-grade security, and succession planning capability (a deceased holder's key can be replaced by a successor's key).</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Can a corporate trustee hold Bitcoin in multisig custody?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Some institutional trustees are building Bitcoin custody capability, but most currently lack the technical infrastructure for self-custody Bitcoin. The directed trust structure solves this: a Bitcoin-competent investment co-trustee holds the custody keys while the corporate trustee handles administrative functions. Before naming a corporate trustee for a Bitcoin trust, ask explicitly about their custody capabilities and multisig infrastructure.</p></div>

        <span class="q-text">What happens to hardware wallets in an estate?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys — but the device itself is not the Bitcoin. The seed phrase (typically 12 or 24 words) is the real access. Hardware wallets can be lost, destroyed, or seized without losing the Bitcoin, as long as the seed phrase is secure and accessible. Your estate plan must document where each hardware wallet is, what it contains, where the corresponding seed phrase is stored, and who has authority to use it.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Should I store seed phrases in my will?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely not. Wills become public record in probate. Listing a seed phrase in a will exposes it to anyone who searches public records — effectively publishing the private key to your Bitcoin. Seed phrases should be stored: physically (metal backup, paper in a fireproof safe), securely (in a location only your designated successor knows), and separately from the hardware wallet. Describe the seed phrase's <em>location</em> in your Letter of Instruction, never the seed phrase itself.</p></div>
    </div>

      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is a geographic key distribution strategy?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>For multisig setups, geographic distribution means storing keys in physically separate locations — one key at your primary residence, one in a bank safe deposit box in a different city, and one held by a trusted professional custodian. This protects against natural disasters, theft, and regional disruptions. For dynasty trusts, geographic distribution across states can provide additional protection against government seizure or regulatory risk.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">How should I document my custody setup for heirs?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Use a Bitcoin Letter of Instruction to document: each wallet's location and what it holds, the type of custody (single-key, multisig, exchange), where seed phrases or access documentation are stored, the contact information for custody co-trustees or professional custodians, and any special instructions for accessing multisig arrangements. Critically: describe WHERE the seed phrase is stored — never write the seed phrase itself in any document.</p></div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is the difference between hot and cold custody?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Hot custody means Bitcoin is on a device connected to the internet — such as an exchange account or software wallet. Cold custody means the private keys are stored on an air-gapped hardware wallet that has never connected to the internet. Cold custody is strongly preferred for significant holdings. Exchange accounts (hot) are subject to custodian insolvency, regulatory seizure, or access denial at death. Cold custody with documented seed phrase storage gives your estate direct ownership.</p></div>

      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">What is the step-up in basis for inherited Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Under current U.S. tax law, inherited property receives a step-up in cost basis to its fair market value at the date of death. For Bitcoin: if you paid $10,000 for 1 BTC that is worth $95,000 at your death, your heir's cost basis is $95,000 — not your original $10,000. If they sell at $95,000, they owe zero capital gains tax. This step-up eliminates decades of embedded capital gains for heirs and is one of the most powerful estate planning benefits for long-term holders.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
        <span class="q-text">Does the wash sale rule apply to Bitcoin?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>As of current law, the wash sale rule does not apply to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is classified as property, not a security. This means Bitcoin holders can sell at a loss to realize the tax benefit, then immediately repurchase, without the 30-day waiting period required for stocks. Note: there is ongoing legislative discussion about extending wash sale rules to digital assets. Consult your CPA for current law.</p></div>

        <span class="q-text">What is the most tax-efficient way to pass Bitcoin to heirs?</span><span class="q-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Holding Bitcoin until death (for the step-up in basis) is often the most tax-efficient transfer for capital gains. For estate tax purposes, transferring appreciated Bitcoin to a GRAT or dynasty trust removes future appreciation from the estate without triggering capital gains at the time of transfer. The optimal strategy depends on expected longevity, BTC price trajectory assumptions, current estate size relative to the exemption, and heir planning goals. This requires coordination between your estate attorney and CPA.</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Donating Bitcoin held more than one year directly to a qualified charity provides a charitable deduction for the full fair market value at the time of donation, with no capital gains recognition on the embedded gain. This is significantly more tax-efficient than selling Bitcoin and donating the cash. For large donations, a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) can provide an income stream while achieving a partial charitable deduction.</p></div>

      <div class="faq-answer"><p>A CRT is an irrevocable trust funded with appreciated Bitcoin. The charity (or a charitable entity) sells the Bitcoin without capital gains recognition. You receive an income stream for life or a term of years. At death, the remainder passes to charity. You receive a partial charitable deduction in the year of contribution. CRTs are best suited for Bitcoin holders with highly appreciated positions, philanthropic intent, and a need for income.</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Bitcoin mining has several estate planning implications. Mining income is ordinary income at receipt. Mined Bitcoin has a cost basis equal to fair market value when mined. Mining equipment can be depreciated (bonus depreciation rules may apply). Mining through a properly structured entity can create tax benefits while accumulating Bitcoin. The Abundant Mines team has compiled an extensive analysis of Bitcoin mining tax strategies at <a href="https://abundantmines.com/tax-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abundantmines.com/tax-strategy/</a> — mining is one of the most powerful Bitcoin tax strategies available.</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>Cost basis is the amount you paid for your Bitcoin (plus any fees). When you sell or transfer Bitcoin, your taxable gain is the sale price minus your cost basis. Accurate basis tracking matters for: calculating capital gains tax on any sale, optimizing which specific coins to sell or transfer (HIFO — highest in, first out — minimizes gains), estate planning analysis (step-up calculations), and gift planning (gifts carry over your basis to the recipient). Keep records of every acquisition: date, amount, price, fees, and exchange.</p></div>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer"><p>At minimum: annually. Additionally, review after any of these events: significant change in Bitcoin price (your estate exposure has materially changed), acquisition of new wallets or change in custody setup, change in family structure (marriage, divorce, birth, death), move to a different state, significant change in federal or state estate/gift tax law, or a change in the professionals managing your plan. Estate plans that are not reviewed regularly become dangerously outdated — especially as digital asset law continues to evolve.</p></div>

    <p style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.85rem;color:var(--text-secondary);line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:1rem;">For high-net-worth Bitcoin holders, mining is the only strategy that simultaneously generates yield, accumulates BTC, and creates significant tax offsets — through equipment depreciation, operating expense deductions, and bonus depreciation on capital investments. Most family offices overlook mining entirely. Abundant Mines has compiled every major Bitcoin mining tax strategy in one place.</p>
