The legal system cannot override cryptographic security -- a court order does not produce the seed phrase. If no one knows the seed phrase or where it is stored, and there is no letter of instructions directing heirs to the backup, the Bitcoin is permanently lost. Estimates suggest millions of Bitcoin are already permanently inaccessible due to lost keys -- the inheritance problem will add significantly to this number as early adopters age."}

The executor or trustee named in the documents has legal authority to claim the Bitcoin -- but if they cannot physically access the hardware wallet (no PIN, no seed phrase backup, no recovery instructions), that legal authority is worthless. Bitcoin access requires both legal authority AND technical access. Most estate plans address only the legal component, leaving the technical component completely unaddressed."}

The letter should specify: where each Bitcoin holding is located (hardware wallet model and physical location, exchange accounts), what custody setup is used (single sig, multisig, which devices), where the seed phrase backup is stored (not the phrase itself -- the location of the backup), and what steps heirs should take in sequence. This letter is not legally binding but it is operationally essential -- without it, legally authorized heirs may still be unable to find or access the Bitcoin."}

A 2-of-3 multisig setup, for example, requires any two of three keys to move Bitcoin. For inheritance, one common setup: you hold one key, a trusted heir holds one key, and an institutional custodian (Unchained, Casa) holds the third. If you die, the heir and custodian can access the Bitcoin using their two keys -- no single point of failure, no reliance on finding your seed phrase. Multisig also eliminates the security risk of storing a seed phrase in a way that is accessible before death."}

It includes: where each holding is located, what custody setup is used, how to access hardware wallets (device location + PIN location or seed phrase location), contact information for any institutional custodian or multisig service, and the sequence of steps heirs should take. You need one if you hold any meaningful amount of Bitcoin in self-custody. Without it, heirs face a technical puzzle at the worst possible time -- while grieving and under legal and financial pressure."}

  <p>Bitcoin's self-custody culture is one of its greatest strengths. "Not your keys, not your coins" is not paranoia — it is sound security practice. The problem is that the same sovereignty that protects Bitcoin from exchange collapses and government seizure also makes it uniquely destructible at death.</p>

  <p>As Bitcoin matures into multi-generational family wealth — with early adopters now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s — the inheritance failure rate will become increasingly visible. Estimates of already-lost Bitcoin range from 3 to 4 million coins. The inheritance problem, left unaddressed across the next decade, will add meaningfully to that number.</p>

  <p>This is not a hypothetical. It is happening now, quietly, in families where the holder died, the heirs knew Bitcoin existed, and they cannot find or access it.</p>

  <p>This guide covers exactly why the problem occurs, why standard legal planning does not fix it, and what actually works.</p>

  <h2 id="the-problem">The Actual Problem With Self-Custody Inheritance</h2>

  <p>The inheritance problem for self-custody Bitcoin has two components that must both be solved:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Legal authority</strong> — who has the legal right to the Bitcoin after the holder's death</li>
    <li><strong>Technical access</strong> — who has the physical and cryptographic ability to move the Bitcoin</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Most estate planning addresses component 1. Almost none address component 2 adequately. The result is heirs who are legally entitled to Bitcoin they cannot physically access.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin on a hardware wallet does not know or care about your will. The private keys do not become accessible because a court says they should be. There is no password recovery, no custodian to call, no account to unfreeze. If the device is gone, the PIN is unknown, and the seed phrase is not documented, the Bitcoin is permanently inaccessible — regardless of what any legal document says.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>The uncomfortable truth:</strong> More Bitcoin will be permanently lost to inheritance failures than to exchange hacks, scams, or regulatory seizure combined. The self-sovereignty ethos that protects Bitcoin from external threats creates a single point of failure in the estate planning dimension that most holders have not addressed.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="why-legal-docs-fail">Why Legal Documents Alone Fail</h2>

  <p>Consider a typical scenario: James, 58, holds 15 Bitcoin on a Coldcard hardware wallet. He has a revocable living trust naming his wife and adult children as beneficiaries. He has a pour-over will. He has a durable power of attorney. His estate attorney did an excellent job on the legal documents.</p>

  <p>James dies unexpectedly. His wife knows he had Bitcoin. She knows it was "significant." She does not know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Which hardware wallet he used (he had three devices, none labeled)</li>
    <li>Where the Coldcard device is stored</li>
    <li>What the device PIN is</li>
    <li>Where the seed phrase backup is stored</li>
    <li>Whether there is a passphrase in addition to the seed phrase</li>
    <li>Whether any Bitcoin is on exchanges, in other wallets, or in lightning channels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The estate attorney is not able to help with any of these questions. The trust document grants the trustee authority to manage digital assets — but authority without access is meaningless. James's Bitcoin is legally his wife's. She will never touch it.</p>

  <p>This scenario plays out constantly. The legal infrastructure is sound. The technical infrastructure — the bridge between legal authority and cryptographic reality — simply does not exist.</p>

  <h2 id="five-failure-modes">Five Failure Modes That Destroy Inheritance</h2>

  <h3>Failure Mode 1: No Documentation of Holdings</h3>
  <p>The heir does not know Bitcoin exists, or knows it exists but does not know where it is held. This is more common than it sounds. Many Bitcoin holders keep their holdings private — from spouses, family members, even financial advisors. When they die, the Bitcoin dies with them. The fix: at minimum, a sealed envelope with the estate attorney documenting that Bitcoin exists and its approximate magnitude. Not the access details — just the fact of its existence and the instruction to seek professional help.</p>

  <h3>Failure Mode 2: The Device Without the PIN</h3>
  <p>The heir finds the hardware wallet but does not know the PIN. After a fixed number of incorrect PIN attempts (varies by device; Coldcard wipes after a configurable number), the device locks permanently. The seed phrase can still restore Bitcoin from a backup — but if the backup is not documented, the device wipe destroys all access. The fix: document the PIN separately from the device, or document where the seed phrase backup is located so that device access is not necessary.</p>

  <h3>Failure Mode 3: The Seed Phrase in the Safe That No One Can Open</h3>
  <p>The holder stored the seed phrase in a fireproof safe. The safe combination is not documented. The heir knows the safe exists but cannot open it. The Bitcoin is a few inches away and completely inaccessible. This is one of the more tragic failure modes — extraordinary security measures that successfully protect Bitcoin from theft also successfully protect it from heirs. The fix: document the safe combination separately with a trusted person, attorney, or in a sealed estate envelope.</p>

  <h3>Failure Mode 4: The Passphrase Layer</h3>
  <p>Modern hardware wallet users often add a "25th word" passphrase to their seed phrase for additional security. The seed phrase (24 words) without the passphrase reveals a different, empty wallet. The heir finds the seed phrase, restores it, sees zero balance, and concludes the Bitcoin is gone. It is not — it is on the passphrase-protected derivation path. Without the passphrase, the Bitcoin is permanently inaccessible even with the correct seed phrase. The fix: document that a passphrase exists and where it is stored, separately from the seed phrase itself.</p>

  <h3>Failure Mode 5: Multisig Without Key Redundancy</h3>
  <p>A Bitcoin holder sets up a 2-of-3 multisig for excellent security reasons. At death, the heir knows about the multisig setup but: one hardware device was the holder's daily driver and is gone (lost with a bag, destroyed, PIN-locked after failed attempts); the second device is in a safe with an unknown combination; and the third is with an institutional custodian. Without two of three keys, the custodian cannot help — the protocol requires 2-of-3. Multisig solves many problems but creates new inheritance-specific failure modes if the key holder map is not documented. The fix: document the multisig configuration completely and ensure the heir knows who holds which key.</p>

  <h2 id="letter-of-instructions">The Letter of Instructions: The First Step</h2>

  <p>The single most impactful thing any Bitcoin holder can do for inheritance planning is write a Bitcoin access letter of instructions. This is a practical document — not legally binding, not part of the will or trust — that tells heirs exactly what to do. It should be stored in a location that is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessible</strong> — the executor or surviving spouse can find it</li>
    <li><strong>Secure enough</strong> — not so insecure that anyone who finds it can steal the Bitcoin</li>
    <li><strong>Known</strong> — at least one trusted person knows where it is</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What the Letter Should Include</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inventory of holdings:</strong> Every wallet, every exchange account, every custody arrangement. Approximate balances. Public addresses for verification.</li>
    <li><strong>Custody setup description:</strong> Single sig? Multisig? Which hardware wallet model(s)? Where are the devices stored?</li>
    <li><strong>Access instructions:</strong> Where the seed phrase backup is stored (not the phrase itself — the location). Where the PIN is documented (or how to reset access using the seed). Whether a passphrase exists and where it is documented.</li>
    <li><strong>Key contacts:</strong> Estate attorney name and contact. If multisig, who holds the other keys and how to reach them. Any institutional custodian account numbers and contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended next steps:</strong> What to do first, what to do second. Who to call. What not to do (do not attempt too many PIN guesses; do not enter the seed phrase on an internet-connected device).</li>
    <li><strong>Date of last update:</strong> This document should be updated whenever the custody setup changes.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Critical distinction:</strong> The letter of instructions does NOT contain the seed phrase itself. It contains the location of the seed phrase backup. This allows the letter to be stored more accessibly than the seed phrase, while the seed phrase itself remains in high-security storage.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Where to Store It</h3>
  <p>Common storage approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With the estate attorney:</strong> In a sealed envelope in the attorney's file. The attorney provides it to the executor at death. Secure, accessible, professionally managed.</li>
    <li><strong>In a bank safe deposit box:</strong> Named co-signer on the box can access it. Limitation: banks may freeze accounts at death; ensure the co-signer has separate, independent access.</li>
    <li><strong>At home in a location known to the executor:</strong> Less secure but highly accessible. Works well combined with a basic lock (small safe, fireproof box) that the executor has the combination for.</li>
    <li><strong>Encrypted digital copy with the estate attorney:</strong> Password provided in the sealed will or through a separate secure channel. Allows the letter to be updated easily without visiting the attorney.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="multisig-solution">Multisig: The Structural Fix</h2>

  <p>The letter of instructions solves the documentation problem. Multisig solves the structural problem — the fact that a single seed phrase is a single point of failure that must be simultaneously secure enough to prevent theft and accessible enough to enable inheritance.</p>

  <p>A 2-of-3 multisig setup eliminates this tension:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key 1 (Grantor):</strong> Hardware wallet held by the Bitcoin holder. Used for daily operations and signing transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Key 2 (Heir or Attorney):</strong> Hardware wallet held by a designated heir or stored with the estate attorney. The heir does not need to know how to use Bitcoin to hold this key — they just need to maintain custody of the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Key 3 (Institutional Custodian):</strong> Held by a service like Unchained Capital or Casa. The custodian holds a key in their secure infrastructure and participates in transactions according to a protocol established in advance, including a death protocol.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At death, the heir and the institutional custodian cooperate to access the Bitcoin using their two keys. No single point of failure. No race against a PIN lockout. No seed phrase hunting. The institutional custodian has a pre-established inheritance protocol and knows exactly what documentation to require before cooperating.</p>

  <h3>The Inheritance Protocol</h3>
  <p>When using an institutional multisig custodian, establish the inheritance protocol in writing before you need it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is the designated heir? (Name, contact information, identification documents required)</li>
    <li>What documentation does the custodian require to trigger the death protocol? (Death certificate, probate documentation, or trust certification)</li>
    <li>What is the timeline? (How long after receiving documentation will the custodian cooperate?)</li>
    <li>What happens to the account if there is no heir claim within a specified time?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Different custodians have different protocols. Evaluate this carefully before choosing a custodian for your multisig setup — the quality of the inheritance protocol matters as much as the quality of the custody security.</p>

  <h2 id="institutional-custody">Institutional Custody Options</h2>

  <p>For some Bitcoin holders, moving from pure self-custody to a partially or fully institutional arrangement makes sense for inheritance purposes. Options range from collaborative custody (you retain a key) to full custodial arrangements:</p>

  <h3>Collaborative Multisig Custodians</h3>
  <p>Services like Unchained Capital and Casa offer 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 multisig where you hold the majority of keys but the custodian holds one key and participates in an established inheritance protocol. You retain full sovereignty in normal operation (your keys control the majority of the quorum), but the custodian provides a reliable inheritance mechanism. This is the recommended approach for most high-net-worth self-custody Bitcoin holders.</p>

  <h3>Qualified Bitcoin Custodians</h3>
  <p>Institutional custodians (Fidelity Digital Assets, Coinbase Custody, BitGo) offer fully custodial Bitcoin custody with the legal and operational infrastructure to handle estate transfers properly. These are appropriate for very large positions (typically $10M+) and for Bitcoin held in irrevocable trust structures where a corporate trustee needs institutional custody support. The tradeoff: you give up self-custody sovereignty in exchange for institutional inheritance reliability.</p>

  <h3>What to Look for in a Bitcoin Custodian for Estate Planning</h3>

    <li>Published inheritance protocol with clear documentation requirements</li>
    <li>Experience working with estate attorneys and trust companies</li>
    <li>Ability to work with irrevocable trust accounts (not just individual accounts)</li>
    <li>Insurance coverage for custodial Bitcoin</li>
    <li>No single point of failure in their own custody architecture (MPC or multisig internally)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="trust-layer">Adding the Trust Layer</h2>

  <p>The letter of instructions and multisig setup solve the technical inheritance problem. A revocable living trust solves the legal inheritance problem — ensuring Bitcoin passes to heirs privately, without probate, with a clearly named trustee who has explicit digital asset authority.</p>

  <p>The trust document needs specific provisions that generic estate planning documents often lack:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Explicit RUFADAA authority:</strong> The trustee must be granted explicit authority to access, manage, and transfer digital assets including Bitcoin. The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act provides the statutory framework, but the trust must affirmatively invoke it.</li>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin custody instructions:</strong> The trust should reference (but not incorporate) the Bitcoin access letter of instructions, so the trustee knows to look for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Specific trustee authority for digital assets:</strong> The trustee should be explicitly authorized to change custody arrangements, work with multisig custodians, sell Bitcoin if needed to pay debts or taxes, and hold Bitcoin as a permanent trust asset without a duty to diversify.</li>
    <li><strong>Successor trustee provisions:</strong> Who manages the Bitcoin if the primary trustee is unable or unwilling? Successor trustee provisions should consider Bitcoin technical competency — a trustee who cannot operate a hardware wallet or coordinate with a multisig custodian cannot effectively manage the trust's primary asset.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="heir-education">Heir Education: The Long Game</h2>

  <p>The letter of instructions and multisig solve the immediate inheritance problem. But they do not solve the long-term stewardship problem: what happens when heirs who are unfamiliar with Bitcoin inherit a significant position?</p>

  <p>The worst inheritance outcomes for Bitcoin involve heirs who:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Panic-sell at a price trough because they do not understand what they hold</li>
    <li>Store Bitcoin unsafely (on an exchange, in a hot wallet) because they do not understand self-custody</li>
    <li>Fall victim to scams targeting "Bitcoin heirs" who are visibly unfamiliar with the technology</li>
    <li>Liquidate Bitcoin to pay estate taxes when other assets could have been used first</li>
    <li>Cannot access Bitcoin that was transferred to a complex multisig setup they do not understand</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Heir education is the long-game solution. It does not mean making your heirs Bitcoin maximalists — it means giving them enough knowledge to make informed decisions with the assets they inherit:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>What Bitcoin is and why you held it:</strong> Your investment thesis, in your words, in a document they can read after you are gone. This prevents panic selling based on ignorance of what the asset is.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic custody mechanics:</strong> Hardware wallets, seed phrases, the difference between self-custody and exchange custody. Not deep technical knowledge — enough to not make avoidable errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Who to call:</strong> Your estate attorney, your Bitcoin custodian, your CPA. A list of trusted advisors who know the situation and can guide heirs without exploiting their ignorance.</li>
    <li><strong>What not to do immediately:</strong> Do not sell. Do not post about the inheritance publicly. Do not respond to anyone who contacts them claiming to be a Bitcoin advisor or offering to help. Do not enter seed phrases anywhere online.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some families formalize this through a family investment policy statement or a Bitcoin letter of wishes — a document expressing the grantor's intent for how the Bitcoin should be managed and held, without being legally binding on the trustee. This provides heirs with context and guidance when they most need it.</p>


  <h2 id="scale">The Scale of the Problem in 2026</h2>

  <p>To understand the magnitude of what is coming, consider the demographics of Bitcoin adoption:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin was first adopted at scale in 2010-2013. The median adopter from that era is now in their late 30s to mid 40s.</li>
    <li>The 2017 bull cycle brought in a large cohort of holders now in their 30s and 40s.</li>
    <li>Bitcoin's maturation into institutional and high-net-worth portfolios has added holders in their 50s and 60s who are in active estate planning years.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The oldest cohort of serious Bitcoin holders is now reaching ages where estate planning urgency is real -- not theoretical. Over the next 10-20 years, a massive transfer of Bitcoin wealth will occur. The question is whether that transfer goes to intended heirs or to cryptographic entropy.</p>

  <p>Industry estimates suggest that 3-4 million Bitcoin are already permanently lost due to forgotten keys, dead founders, destroyed devices, and inaccessible wallets. If even 1% of Bitcoin held today -- approximately 200,000 coins at current supply -- is lost due to inheritance failures over the next decade, that represents $13 billion at current prices, and potentially multiples of that as Bitcoin's price evolves.</p>

  <p>This is not a problem that the legal system can solve retroactively. It is a problem that each individual Bitcoin holder must solve proactively, for their own estate, with appropriate planning.</p>

  <h2 id="special-cases">Special Cases That Compound the Risk</h2>

  <h3>Holders Who Kept Bitcoin Secret</h3>
  <p>Some Bitcoin holders, for privacy or tax reasons, have not disclosed their Bitcoin holdings to family members. When they die, no one knows to look for Bitcoin. This is perhaps the most complete form of inheritance failure -- the asset cannot even be identified as missing. The fix requires at minimum telling the estate attorney that Bitcoin exists, even if the amount and access details are kept private from family members during life.</p>

  <h3>Long-Term Holders With Multiple Wallets</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin holders who have been active for 5-10+ years often have Bitcoin scattered across multiple wallets, multiple hardware devices, multiple exchanges (some defunct), and potentially paper wallets from early years. The inventory problem alone -- just mapping out all holdings -- can take significant effort. This makes documentation even more critical: the holder is the only person who knows the full map, and that map disappears at death.</p>

  <h3>Technical Holders Whose Heirs Are Not Technical</h3>
  <p>Some Bitcoin holders have sophisticated self-custody setups: air-gapped signing devices, Shamir Secret Sharing for seed backup, custom scripts for key derivation. These setups may be highly secure -- and completely opaque to heirs who are not technical. The documentation challenge is proportionally harder. Consider whether the security complexity is proportionate to the threat model, and whether simpler alternatives (collaborative multisig with an institutional custodian) would better serve the inheritance goal without sacrificing meaningful security.</p>

  <h3>Holders Who Set Up Multisig Incorrectly for Inheritance</h3>
  <p>Some holders set up 2-of-2 multisig for security -- requiring both keys to sign. This is excellent for preventing theft but catastrophic for inheritance: if one key is lost (the deceased's device), the Bitcoin is permanently locked. Multisig structures intended to include inheritance functionality should use M-of-N configurations where N is larger than the inheritance quorum needed. A 2-of-3 provides inheritance access (heir + custodian) while maintaining security during life (you + custodian, or you + heir).</p>

  <h2 id="action-plan">What to Do This Week</h2>

  <p>You do not need a complete estate plan in place to meaningfully reduce inheritance risk. These steps can be completed in hours:</p>

  <h3>Today</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Write a one-page Bitcoin inventory: where it is held, roughly how much, and the name of one person to contact for help. Store it with your estate documents or in a sealed envelope with your attorney.</li>
    <li>Tell your executor (spouse, trusted person) that Bitcoin exists and where the inventory document is. You do not need to share access details — just confirm the asset exists and where to look.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>This Week</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Write the full letter of instructions (described above) covering every holding, custody setup, and access procedure.</li>
    <li>If you use a hardware wallet: ensure the seed phrase backup is in a fireproof, waterproof location, and that at least one trusted person knows where it is (not the phrase itself, the location).</li>
    <li>Review your revocable trust or will: does it explicitly mention digital assets and grant the trustee or executor authority to access them? If not, this is the single most important legal fix to make.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>This Month</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate multisig collaborative custody if you hold more than $500,000 in Bitcoin. The one-time setup cost is modest relative to the inheritance reliability it provides.</li>
    <li>Schedule a consultation with a Bitcoin estate attorney to review your current documents and identify gaps.</li>
    <li>Begin a basic heir education conversation: tell your intended heirs that Bitcoin exists, what it is at a high level, and who to call when the time comes.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id="professional-help">When to Get Professional Help</h2>

  <p>The letter of instructions and basic multisig setup can be done independently. But some situations warrant professional assistance:</p>

  <h3>Engage a Bitcoin Estate Attorney When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Bitcoin position exceeds $500,000 and you have not reviewed your estate documents in the past 2 years</li>
    <li>Your revocable trust or will does not explicitly reference digital assets or grant trustees RUFADAA authority</li>
    <li>You have estate tax exposure at the state or federal level and want to evaluate irrevocable trust structures</li>
    <li>You have a complex custody setup (multisig, multiple wallets, early paper wallets) and want professional help documenting access protocols</li>
    <li>You hold Bitcoin in an IRA and need to review beneficiary designations and Roth conversion options</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Engage a Collaborative Multisig Custodian When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You hold more than $250,000 in pure self-custody and want to add inheritance reliability without giving up key control</li>
    <li>Your heirs are not technical and you want a custodian who can guide them through the inheritance process</li>
    <li>You travel frequently or have other circumstances that create risk of your primary device being inaccessible</li>
    <li>You want to formally document the inheritance protocol with a professional third party rather than relying solely on the letter of instructions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Engage a Bitcoin-Aware CPA When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You have not done a comprehensive basis audit of your Bitcoin holdings and need to establish what your heirs will inherit as cost basis</li>
    <li>You have Bitcoin in both taxable accounts and IRAs and want to coordinate the estate tax and income tax implications</li>
    <li>Your estate has grown large enough that Roth conversion or other tax-reduction strategies during life are worth evaluating</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The goal is not to build a complex advisory relationship -- it is to close the specific gaps that create inheritance risk. Many holders can address the most critical gaps (letter of instructions, trust with digital asset authority, multisig setup) with a focused 60-90 day engagement rather than an ongoing advisory relationship.</p>

  <h2 id="not-about-taxes">A Final Note: This Is Not Primarily a Tax Problem</h2>

  <p>Most Bitcoin estate planning content focuses on estate tax minimization -- GRATs, dynasty trusts, lifetime exemption transfers. These are important for high-net-worth holders with taxable estates. But they are secondary to the more fundamental problem: whether Bitcoin can reach heirs at all.</p>

  <p>A perfectly structured dynasty trust holding Bitcoin that no one can access is worth nothing. A basic revocable trust with a clear letter of instructions and a 2-of-3 multisig setup is worth everything.</p>

  <p>The tax optimization layer is built on top of the access layer. Prioritize in sequence:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Can your heirs find your Bitcoin?</strong> (Inventory + disclosure)</li>
    <li><strong>Can your heirs access your Bitcoin?</strong> (Letter of instructions + multisig or documented seed phrase)</li>
    <li><strong>Do your legal documents give heirs the authority to act?</strong> (Trust with RUFADAA authority)</li>
    <li><strong>Is the estate structured to minimize taxes on the transfer?</strong> (Irrevocable trust strategies)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Too many holders skip to step 4 without completing steps 1-3. The result is sophisticated tax planning protecting Bitcoin that heirs can never access.</p>

  <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border);">
      <h3 style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:500;color:var(--text);text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:0.75rem;">Can Bitcoin be lost forever when someone dies without a plan?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:var(--text-secondary);margin-bottom:0;">Yes. Self-custody Bitcoin without documented access instructions is permanently inaccessible to heirs if the seed phrase cannot be found. A court order cannot override cryptographic security. Estimates suggest 3-4 million Bitcoin are already permanently inaccessible from lost keys; inheritance failures will add significantly to this number over the next decade as early adopters age.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border);">
      <h3 style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:500;color:var(--text);text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:0.75rem;">Does a will or trust automatically give heirs access to Bitcoin?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:var(--text-secondary);margin-bottom:0;">No. A will or trust provides legal authority to claim Bitcoin, not technical access to the coins. Without the PIN, seed phrase, or passphrase, a legally authorized heir or trustee cannot move the Bitcoin. Estate planning must address both components: legal authority (documents) and technical access (custody instructions). Most plans address only the former.</p>

    <div style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border);">
      <h3 style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:500;color:var(--text);text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:0.75rem;">What is the single most important thing I can do to protect my Bitcoin for heirs?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:var(--text-secondary);margin-bottom:0;">Write a letter of instructions and store it accessibly. The letter should specify where each holding is, what custody setup is used, where the seed phrase backup is located (not the phrase itself, the location), and who to contact for help. This alone -- done today, before any other estate planning -- closes the most common and most catastrophic inheritance failure mode.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:500;color:var(--text);text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:0.75rem;">How does multisig solve the Bitcoin inheritance problem?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:var(--text-secondary);margin-bottom:0;">Multisig requires multiple keys to authorize transactions. A 2-of-3 setup means no single key holder can access or lose the Bitcoin alone. For inheritance, the heir holds one key, an institutional custodian holds another. At death, the custodian cooperates per a pre-established inheritance protocol. No seed phrase hunting, no device PIN race, no single point of failure. Collaborative multisig custodians (Unchained, Casa) make this practical for most holders.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family:var(--sans);font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:500;color:var(--text);text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:0.75rem;">What is a Bitcoin inheritance protocol and do I need one?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem;color:var(--text-secondary);margin-bottom:0;">A Bitcoin inheritance protocol is the documented procedure your heirs follow to locate and access Bitcoin after your death. It includes the inventory of holdings, custody setup description, access instructions, key contacts, and what to do and not do. If you hold any meaningful amount of Bitcoin in self-custody, you need one. Without it, heirs face a technical puzzle at the worst possible time -- while grieving and under legal and financial pressure -- with Bitcoin permanently at stake.</p>
