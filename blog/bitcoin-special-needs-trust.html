    <strong>The Critical Planning Error:</strong> A Bitcoin holder leaves $500,000 of Bitcoin directly to their adult child with a disability. The child receives SSI and Medicaid. The inheritance immediately disqualifies them from both programs. Their monthly income drops, their healthcare coverage ends, and they must spend down the Bitcoin to under $2,000 before they can requalify. A Third-Party Special Needs Trust, costing a few thousand dollars to draft, would have prevented this entirely.

  <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem: Why Direct Bitcoin Inheritance Is Dangerous for Disabled Beneficiaries</h2>

  <p>The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program imposes a strict asset limit: an individual receiving SSI cannot own more than $2,000 in countable assets. Medicaid eligibility in most states follows similar resource limits. These programs are essential for millions of Americans with disabilities -- providing income, healthcare, housing assistance, and long-term care coverage that private resources cannot fully replace.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin, like any other asset, counts toward these resource limits the moment a disabled person receives it. A $50,000 Bitcoin inheritance creates immediate ineligibility. A $500,000 Bitcoin inheritance eliminates benefits and forces a spend-down over years before the person can requalify -- by which point a significant portion of the inheritance may be gone to expenses that Medicaid would have covered for free.</p>

  <p>The tragedy is that this outcome is entirely avoidable. Bitcoin -- along with any other assets -- can be held in a properly structured Special Needs Trust where it is legally owned by the trust, not the beneficiary. The beneficiary uses trust funds for supplemental expenses but retains full government benefit eligibility. The Bitcoin grows, is managed by a qualified trustee, and provides a lifetime of supplemental support without ever disqualifying the beneficiary from the programs they depend on.</p>

  <h3>Which Government Benefits Are at Risk</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supplemental Security Income (SSI):</strong> Federal program providing monthly income to disabled individuals with limited assets. Asset limit: $2,000 per individual. Any countable asset above this limit triggers disqualification.</li>
    <li><strong>Medicaid:</strong> State-federal health insurance for low-income individuals. In most states, Medicaid eligibility is tied to SSI status or similar asset limits. Loss of SSI often means loss of Medicaid.</li>
    <li><strong>Section 8 Housing:</strong> Subsidized housing assistance is income- and asset-tested in many jurisdictions. A Bitcoin inheritance can affect housing assistance eligibility.</li>
    <li><strong>State disability programs:</strong> Many states offer supplemental disability payments, housing, and services programs that apply similar means-testing to federal programs.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>Important: SSDI Is Different</h4>
    <p>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is not means-tested -- it is based on work history and is not affected by asset ownership. If a disabled beneficiary receives SSDI but not SSI, direct Bitcoin inheritance does not affect their SSDI payments. However, if they receive Medicaid through SSI linkage, or receive any state means-tested programs, those programs can still be affected. Always consult an attorney familiar with the specific programs the beneficiary receives before making any estate planning decisions.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="snt-explained">What Is a Special Needs Trust?</h2>

  <p>A Special Needs Trust (SNT) -- sometimes called a Supplemental Needs Trust -- is an irrevocable trust designed specifically to hold assets for the benefit of a person with a disability without disqualifying them from means-tested government benefit programs. It accomplishes this through a fundamental legal distinction: the assets belong to the trust, not to the beneficiary. The beneficiary has no legal ownership of and no direct access to the trust assets.</p>

  <p>The trustee controls all trust assets and makes all distribution decisions. Distributions are made for specific qualifying expenses -- not as cash to the beneficiary -- in a manner designed to supplement the beneficiary's government benefits without triggering income or resource counting rules.</p>

  <h3>The Core Legal Framework</h3>

  <p>Special Needs Trusts exist at the intersection of several bodies of law: Social Security Administration regulations (for SSI), Medicaid regulations (which vary by state), and general trust law. The trust must be carefully drafted to satisfy SSI and Medicaid rules simultaneously, which is why SNT drafting is a specialized legal area distinct from general estate planning.</p>

  <p>The governing federal statute for First-Party SNTs is 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p(d)(4)(A) -- commonly called the "d4A trust" provision. Third-Party SNTs, which are used for estate planning, are governed by general trust law and the SSI/Medicaid regulations applicable to third-party resources.</p>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>For Bitcoin estate planning purposes, the Third-Party SNT is almost always the correct structure. When you leave Bitcoin to a Third-Party SNT through your will, living trust, or direct designation, the Bitcoin enters the trust without ever being owned by the disabled beneficiary -- so there is no Medicaid payback obligation and remaining Bitcoin can pass cleanly to other family members after the beneficiary's death.</p>

  <h2 id="how-bitcoin-is-held">How Bitcoin Is Held Inside a Special Needs Trust</h2>

  <p>A Special Needs Trust can hold Bitcoin, but the custody arrangement requires careful planning. The trust, as a legal entity, must have a method for taking title to and maintaining custody of digital assets. This is where Bitcoin's unique characteristics create both challenges and opportunities compared to traditional assets like stocks or cash.</p>

  <h3>Option 1: Professional Trustee with Direct Custody</h3>

  <p>A professional corporate trustee (a trust company with digital asset capability) takes direct custody of the Bitcoin using institutional-grade custody infrastructure. The trustee holds the private keys, maintains insurance, and has documented processes for managing the Bitcoin as a trust asset. This is the cleanest structure from a legal and benefit-preservation standpoint: the trust company is the obvious fiduciary, the custody arrangement is documented, and the beneficiary has no conceivable access to the private keys.</p>

  <p>The challenge: most traditional corporate trustees do not accept Bitcoin. Wyoming-chartered directed trust companies with digital asset capabilities are the most likely to accept Bitcoin trusts. See our guide on <a href="/blog/bitcoin-trustee-selection-guide">how to choose a Bitcoin trustee</a> for the full landscape.</p>

  <h3>Option 2: Directed Trust with Separate Investment Director</h3>

  <p>A <a href="/blog/bitcoin-wyoming-trust-llc">Wyoming directed trust</a> structure separates the investment function (who manages the Bitcoin) from the administrative function (who handles distributions and benefit compliance). The investment director -- a Bitcoin custody specialist or family member with Bitcoin expertise -- controls the custody arrangement. The administrative trustee -- a corporate trust company -- handles all distributions and benefit compliance without needing direct Bitcoin expertise.</p>

  <p>This structure is particularly powerful for Bitcoin SNTs because it allows a Bitcoin-literate family member or specialist to manage the custody without the administrative trustee needing to understand seed phrases, hardware wallets, or multi-signature arrangements.</p>

  <h3>Option 3: Regulated Custodian as Sub-Custodian</h3>

  <p>A regulated Bitcoin custodian (Coinbase Custody, BitGo, Anchorage Digital, etc.) holds the Bitcoin as sub-custodian on behalf of the trust. The trustee maintains the account relationship and legal control; the custodian provides secure storage. This approach works well when the trustee is an individual (a parent or sibling acting as trustee) who wants institutional-grade security without managing custody directly.</p>

  <h3>Key Custody Considerations for Bitcoin SNTs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The beneficiary must have zero access to the Bitcoin or the private keys.</strong> Any arrangement where the beneficiary can independently access or move the Bitcoin undermines the trust structure and could be treated as a countable resource.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust ownership must be documentable.</strong> The SSA and Medicaid agencies may ask for documentation of the trust assets. Exchange accounts and custodian accounts should be titled in the trust's name (e.g., "The [Name] Special Needs Trust, [Trustee Name], Trustee").</li>
    <li><strong>Self-custody hardware wallets require extra care.</strong> If Bitcoin is held on a hardware wallet, the seed phrase and device must be secured by the trustee with no beneficiary access. This is feasible but requires rigorous documentation of the custody arrangement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="trustee-selection">Trustee Selection for a Bitcoin Special Needs Trust</h2>

  <p>The trustee of a Bitcoin Special Needs Trust carries an unusually demanding dual mandate: they must be expert in Bitcoin custody (or delegate that function appropriately) AND expert in disability benefits law (or work closely with a benefits coordinator). These competencies rarely coexist in a single person, which is why the directed trust structure -- separating investment direction from administration -- is particularly well-suited to Bitcoin SNTs.</p>

  <h3>What the Trustee Must Do</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Manage or oversee the custody of Bitcoin with fiduciary-grade security</li>
    <li>Track SSI and Medicaid rules to ensure distributions do not affect benefit eligibility</li>
    <li>Maintain detailed distribution records in the format required by SSA and state Medicaid agencies</li>
    <li>File annual trust accountings as required by state law</li>
    <li>Respond to SSA or Medicaid inquiries about trust assets and distributions</li>
    <li>Coordinate with a Special Needs Trust attorney or benefits coordinator when rules change</li>
    <li>Make distribution decisions that genuinely serve the beneficiary's supplemental needs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Individual Trustee Considerations</h3>

  <p>A family member (parent, sibling) can serve as trustee of a Third-Party SNT, but they take on significant fiduciary responsibility. Many family member trustees work with a professional SNT administrator or benefits coordinator who handles the compliance aspects while the family member retains decision-making authority. If the family member also holds Bitcoin, they should be careful to keep trust Bitcoin clearly separate from personal Bitcoin holdings -- commingling is a serious fiduciary breach.</p>

  <h3>Professional Trustee Considerations</h3>

  <p>Corporate trust companies that accept Bitcoin SNTs are rare but increasing. Wyoming-chartered directed trust companies are the most progressive; some have specific experience with digital asset SNTs. When evaluating a corporate trustee, ask: do they have an established policy for digital asset trusts, do they work with Bitcoin custodians or have internal custody capability, and do they have staff familiar with SSI and Medicaid benefit rules?</p>

  <h2 id="what-snt-can-pay">What the Trust Can and Cannot Pay For</h2>

  <p>SSI benefit rules distinguish between expenses that supplement government benefits (permitted) and expenses that replace government benefits (potentially problematic). The trustee must understand this distinction intimately, because an improperly structured distribution can reduce the beneficiary's SSI payment or, in extreme cases, affect eligibility.</p>

  <h3>Generally Permitted Supplemental Expenses</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Education, tutoring, and vocational training</li>
    <li>Recreation, entertainment, travel, and vacations</li>
    <li>Technology: computers, tablets, phones, assistive devices</li>
    <li>Transportation: vehicle purchase or modification, ride services</li>
    <li>Personal care items beyond what Medicaid covers</li>
    <li>Home furnishings, decorating, and personal property</li>
    <li>Legal, financial, and professional services</li>
    <li>Therapies and medical treatments not covered by Medicaid</li>
    <li>Hobbies, sports equipment, musical instruments</li>
    <li>Premiums for supplemental health or life insurance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In-Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) -- Handle Carefully</h3>

  <p>The SSA treats payment for food or shelter on behalf of an SSI recipient as "In-Kind Support and Maintenance" (ISM). ISM reduces the SSI monthly payment by up to one-third of the Federal Benefit Rate plus $20. Trust distributions for rent, mortgage payments, utilities, or food directly may reduce -- though not eliminate -- the SSI payment. The trustee and benefits coordinator must carefully analyze whether particular distributions constitute ISM and calculate the impact before making them.</p>

  <h3>Never Make Direct Cash Distributions</h3>

  <p>Cash distributions directly to the beneficiary count as unearned income in the month received and reduce SSI dollar-for-dollar (after a $20 exclusion). The trustee should pay vendors and service providers directly, never give cash to the beneficiary for them to spend on their own behalf.</p>

  <h2 id="distribution-rules">Distribution Rules That Protect Benefits</h2>

  <p>The trustee's distribution practices are as important as the trust's legal structure. A correctly drafted SNT can still disqualify the beneficiary from benefits if the trustee makes careless distributions.</p>

  <h3>The Discretionary Distribution Standard</h3>

  <p>The trust document should give the trustee full discretionary authority over distributions -- not a mandatory distribution requirement. Mandatory distributions (e.g., "the trustee SHALL distribute $1,000 per month to the beneficiary") can create countable income or resources. A fully discretionary standard ("the trustee MAY distribute for the supplemental needs of the beneficiary") preserves trustee flexibility to make distributions in a way that protects benefits.</p>

  <h3>Distribution Documentation</h3>

  <p>Every distribution should be documented with: the date, the amount, the payee (vendor, not beneficiary), the purpose, and the relationship to supplemental needs. This documentation protects the trustee in any SSA or Medicaid review and provides a clear record for the annual trust accounting.</p>

  <h3>Annual Benefit Review</h3>

  <p>SSI and Medicaid rules change. The trustee should conduct an annual review with a Special Needs Trust attorney or benefits coordinator to ensure distribution practices remain compliant. Changes in federal SSI regulations, state Medicaid rules, or the beneficiary's individual circumstances can affect what distributions are safe.</p>

  <h2 id="drafting-requirements">Drafting Requirements for Bitcoin Special Needs Trusts</h2>

  <p>A Bitcoin SNT requires specialized drafting that addresses both the general requirements of a valid Special Needs Trust and the specific requirements of holding Bitcoin as a trust asset. Generic SNT templates are insufficient -- the trust must be customized by an attorney with experience in both disability law and digital asset estate planning.</p>

  <h3>Required SNT Provisions</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Disability definition:</strong> Clearly defines who qualifies as a disabled beneficiary for purposes of the trust</li>
    <li><strong>Supplemental purpose clause:</strong> Explicitly states that trust distributions are intended to supplement, not replace, government benefits</li>
    <li><strong>Government benefit preservation clause:</strong> Directs the trustee to administer the trust in a manner that preserves the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits</li>
    <li><strong>Discretionary distribution standard:</strong> Full trustee discretion over distributions; no mandatory distribution requirement</li>
    <li><strong>Spendthrift provisions:</strong> Prevents the beneficiary from assigning or encumbering their interest in the trust</li>
    <li><strong>Successor trustee provisions:</strong> Clearly defined succession to prevent gaps in trust administration</li>
    <li><strong>Remainder beneficiaries:</strong> Clearly specifies who receives remaining trust assets after the beneficiary's death (critical for Third-Party SNTs; no Medicaid payback required)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bitcoin-Specific Provisions to Add</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital asset authority:</strong> Explicit trustee authority to hold, manage, custody, transfer, and sell Bitcoin and other digital assets as trust property</li>
    <li><strong>Custody delegation authority:</strong> Authority to engage regulated custodians, directed trust structures, or multi-signature custody providers on behalf of the trust</li>
    <li><strong>Investment director provisions</strong> (if using directed trust): Clear definition of the investment director's authority over Bitcoin custody decisions</li>
    <li><strong>Volatility management provisions:</strong> Authority to rebalance, convert, or liquidate Bitcoin positions in the trustee's discretion -- important given Bitcoin's price volatility relative to the beneficiary's stable needs</li>
    <li><strong>Key management succession:</strong> Provisions addressing what happens to hardware wallets, seed phrases, and custody arrangements when a trustee changes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="pooled-trusts">Pooled Special Needs Trusts: An Alternative for Smaller Balances</h2>

  <p>For Bitcoin holdings that do not justify the administrative overhead of a standalone SNT, a Pooled Special Needs Trust may be an option. Pooled SNTs are managed by nonprofit organizations that pool the assets of many beneficiaries for investment purposes while maintaining separate accounts for each beneficiary.</p>

  <p>However, very few pooled SNT administrators currently accept Bitcoin as a trust asset -- most are equipped only for traditional investment portfolios. Before considering a pooled SNT for Bitcoin, verify whether the pooled trust administrator has a policy for digital assets. If they do not, a standalone Third-Party SNT with appropriate custody arrangements is the only viable path.</p>

  <h2 id="coordinating-with-estate">Coordinating the SNT with Your Overall Estate Plan</h2>

  <p>A Bitcoin Special Needs Trust does not exist in isolation -- it must be integrated with your will, revocable living trust, beneficiary designations, and any other estate planning documents to ensure the Bitcoin reaches the SNT rather than passing directly to the disabled beneficiary.</p>

  <h3>Four Ways Bitcoin Can Pass to the SNT</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Specific bequest in will:</strong> Your will includes a specific provision leaving Bitcoin to the SNT by name. Simple, but Bitcoin that passes through probate is public and delayed.</li>
    <li><strong>Pour-over from revocable living trust:</strong> A <a href="/blog/bitcoin-pour-over-will">pour-over will</a> directs all probate assets (including any Bitcoin not specifically titled in the trust) into your revocable living trust, which then distributes to the SNT. Provides a safety net.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct transfer from revocable trust:</strong> Bitcoin is titled in your revocable living trust during your lifetime; at death, the trust distributes to the SNT. Avoids probate entirely.</li>
    <li><strong>TOD (Transfer on Death) designation:</strong> If the custodian or exchange allows TOD designations, the Bitcoin can transfer directly to the SNT at death without probate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Coordinate with All Other Beneficiary Designations</h3>

  <p>Any Bitcoin IRA or retirement account should name the SNT as beneficiary if the disabled person is an intended recipient -- NOT the disabled person directly. See our guide on <a href="/blog/bitcoin-inherited-ira-rules">Bitcoin inherited IRA rules</a> for the specific rules around trust beneficiaries for retirement accounts (a conduit trust may be required to preserve stretch IRA treatment).</p>

  <h2 id="bitcoin-volatility">Managing Bitcoin Volatility Inside the Trust</h2>

  <p>Bitcoin's price volatility creates a specific challenge for Special Needs Trusts: the beneficiary has stable, ongoing supplemental needs (therapies, transportation, technology) that require consistent funding, but the trust's primary asset may swing dramatically in value. A trustee who holds 100% Bitcoin in an SNT is making an implicit bet that Bitcoin will not decline substantially at the exact moment a major distribution is needed.</p>

  <h3>Volatility Management Strategies for Bitcoin SNTs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operating reserve in stable assets:</strong> Maintain 12-24 months of anticipated distributions in cash or stable assets. Bitcoin appreciation funds the reserve; the reserve funds distributions regardless of Bitcoin price. This prevents forced Bitcoin sales at market lows.</li>
    <li><strong>Systematic rebalancing:</strong> Set a target allocation (e.g., 80% Bitcoin / 20% stable) and rebalance annually or when Bitcoin exceeds the target. Lock in gains periodically without abandoning the long-term Bitcoin position.</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution planning around price levels:</strong> For large discretionary distributions (a vehicle purchase, a home modification), consider timing around periods when Bitcoin is up rather than down. The trustee has full discretion over timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin appreciation as reinvestment:</strong> When Bitcoin prices are high and the operating reserve is well-funded, consider larger distributions for durable goods (home furnishings, technology, vehicles) that provide long-term value even if Bitcoin declines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="after-death">What Happens After the Beneficiary Dies</h2>

  <p>For a Third-Party Special Needs Trust -- the type used for estate planning -- the treatment of remaining Bitcoin after the beneficiary's death is one of the most compelling advantages of this structure over alternatives.</p>

  <p>There is no Medicaid payback obligation. The state does not receive any portion of the remaining Bitcoin. The trust document specifies what happens to remaining assets: they pass to named remainder beneficiaries (other children, grandchildren, charity) according to the grantor's wishes.</p>

  <p>This means the Bitcoin can continue its planned multi-generational transfer strategy. If the SNT was designed as part of a broader <a href="/blog/bitcoin-dynasty-trust">dynasty trust</a> framework, remaining Bitcoin from the SNT can pour over into the family dynasty trust at the special needs beneficiary's death, continuing tax-advantaged compounding across the next generation.</p>

  <h2 id="tax-treatment">Tax Treatment of a Bitcoin Special Needs Trust</h2>

  <p>A Third-Party Special Needs Trust is typically structured as an irrevocable trust, which has important tax implications. Understanding the tax layer is essential for the trustee and for the broader estate plan.</p>

  <h3>Income Tax Inside the Trust</h3>

  <p>An irrevocable Third-Party SNT is its own tax entity and files its own income tax return (Form 1041). Trust income tax rates compress quickly: the highest federal rate of 37% applies to trust ordinary income above approximately $15,000 (2026 threshold). This means that if the Bitcoin trust generates significant taxable income (from Bitcoin sales, for example), the trust may owe substantial income taxes at rates higher than an individual would pay on the same income.</p>

  <p>Strategies to manage trust income tax:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hold Bitcoin -- do not sell it:</strong> Bitcoin held without selling does not generate taxable income inside the trust. The trust only realizes taxable gain when Bitcoin is sold. A buy-and-hold strategy defers this tax indefinitely.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributable Net Income (DNI) distributions:</strong> If the trust distributes income to the beneficiary (as allowed under the trust terms for qualifying expenses), the income may be taxable to the beneficiary rather than the trust -- at the beneficiary's likely lower rate. However, this must be balanced against the SSI income counting rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax-loss harvesting:</strong> If the trust holds both Bitcoin and other assets, coordinating gains and losses can reduce trust-level income tax.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Estate Tax Treatment at the Grantor's Death</h3>

  <p>Bitcoin contributed to a Third-Party SNT through an estate plan passes at the grantor's death. It is included in the grantor's taxable estate and subject to estate tax if the estate exceeds the applicable exemption. The SNT itself does not reduce estate tax on assets transferred at death -- it only controls how those assets are held and distributed after the transfer.</p>

  <p>For large Bitcoin estates where estate tax is a concern, the SNT should be coordinated with other estate tax reduction strategies: annual gifting programs, <a href="/blog/bitcoin-grat-grantor-retained-annuity-trust">GRATs</a>, <a href="/blog/bitcoin-idgt-installment-sale">IDGT installment sales</a>, or Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs). Funding the SNT with Bitcoin during lifetime -- through completed gifts -- removes the Bitcoin from the taxable estate, but the gift must be structured carefully to avoid creating a countable resource for the beneficiary before the trust is fully operational.</p>

  <h3>Step-Up in Basis</h3>

  <p>Bitcoin held in a Third-Party SNT and passing at the grantor's death through the estate receives a step-up in cost basis to the fair market value at the date of death. This step-up eliminates the capital gains on any appreciation during the grantor's lifetime. This is a powerful feature: if a grantor purchased Bitcoin at $10,000 and it is worth $200,000 at death, the trust receives the Bitcoin with a $200,000 basis -- meaning no capital gains tax on that $190,000 of appreciation. See our guide on <a href="/blog/bitcoin-step-up-in-basis-at-death">Bitcoin step-up in basis at death</a> for the full framework.</p>

  <h2 id="letter-of-instructions-coordination">Coordinating with a Letter of Instructions</h2>

  <p>A Bitcoin Special Needs Trust adds an extra layer to your estate administration that your executor and trustee must understand clearly. The trust document establishes the legal structure; a well-drafted <a href="/blog/bitcoin-letter-of-instructions">letter of instructions</a> ensures the right people know what to do and in what order.</p>

  <p>Your letter of instructions should specifically address the SNT:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The full legal name of the Special Needs Trust</li>
    <li>The trustee's name, institution, and direct contact information</li>
    <li>A note that Bitcoin designated for the SNT must be transferred to the trustee before any other estate administration steps -- do not allow the disabled beneficiary to receive any Bitcoin directly, even temporarily</li>
    <li>The name of the SNT drafting attorney who can answer trustee questions about benefit compliance</li>
    <li>The name of the benefits coordinator or disability attorney who monitors SSI/Medicaid compliance</li>
    <li>A reminder that the trust is a separate tax entity and requires a separate EIN and annual tax filing</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:var(--text-muted);font-style:italic;margin:1.5rem 0;">This guide reflects Special Needs Trust law and SSI/Medicaid regulations as of March 2026. SNT rules are complex, vary by state, and change over time. This is not legal advice. Special Needs Trust planning requires an attorney experienced in both disability benefits law and digital asset estate planning -- do not use a generic SNT template for Bitcoin holdings.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Can I leave Bitcoin to a disabled beneficiary?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, but not directly. Leaving Bitcoin directly to a beneficiary who receives SSI or Medicaid can immediately disqualify them from those programs. The correct structure is a Third-Party Special Needs Trust: the Bitcoin is owned by the trust, not the beneficiary, so it does not count toward benefit eligibility. The trustee uses trust funds for supplemental expenses that supplement -- not replace -- the government benefits the beneficiary receives.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between a First-Party and Third-Party Special Needs Trust?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A First-Party SNT is funded with the disabled person's own assets -- for example, a direct inheritance already received or a lawsuit settlement. It requires a Medicaid payback provision at the beneficiary's death. A Third-Party SNT is funded with someone else's assets -- a parent's Bitcoin, for example -- and does NOT require Medicaid payback. Remaining assets pass to other family members. For estate planning, Third-Party SNTs are almost always the right choice.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How is Bitcoin held in a Special Needs Trust?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Bitcoin in an SNT is held either by a professional trustee with digital asset capability, through a directed trust structure with a separate investment director managing custody, or via a regulated Bitcoin custodian (Coinbase Custody, BitGo) holding the Bitcoin as sub-custodian on behalf of the trust. The beneficiary must have zero direct access to the Bitcoin or private keys -- any beneficiary access could undermine the trust structure and affect benefit eligibility.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What expenses can a Special Needs Trust pay for?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">SNT funds can pay for supplemental expenses that go beyond what government benefits cover: education, recreation, travel, technology, transportation, personal care items, therapy not covered by Medicaid, home furnishings, legal fees, and professional services. The trust should not pay for food and shelter in ways that trigger In-Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) reductions, and should never make direct cash distributions to the beneficiary, as these count as income and reduce SSI payments.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What happens to Bitcoin in a Special Needs Trust when the beneficiary dies?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">For a Third-Party SNT -- the kind used for estate planning -- there is no Medicaid payback. Remaining Bitcoin passes directly to named remainder beneficiaries as specified in the trust: other children, grandchildren, or charity. This is a major advantage over First-Party SNTs. Properly structured, remaining Bitcoin can pour into a family dynasty trust at the special needs beneficiary's death, continuing the multi-generational wealth transfer strategy.</div>
