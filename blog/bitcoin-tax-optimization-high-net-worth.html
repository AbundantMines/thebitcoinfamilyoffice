<p>The tax code was not designed for an asset like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It was designed for equities, real estate, and fixed income — assets that behave predictably within the existing monetary system. They generate dividends, rents, and coupons. They're held by regulated custodians who issue 1099s. They trade during market hours, in dollars, on established exchanges. The tax infrastructure around these assets has been refined over a century of practice.</p>

<p>Bitcoin doesn't fit this model. It exhibits the volatility profile of a venture-stage technology company, the holding characteristics of a commodity, the transfer mechanics of a currency, and the scarcity attributes of precious metals. It trades 24/7/365 across global, largely unregulated markets. It can be self-custodied outside any institutional framework. And the IRS has decided to treat it as property.</p>

<p>This classification — property — creates both significant challenges and extraordinary opportunities for families with meaningful Bitcoin positions. The challenges are obvious: every disposition of Bitcoin, including spending it, is a taxable event requiring a capital gains calculation. The opportunities are less obvious but potentially more consequential: the same property classification enables strategies for tax deferral, reduction, and elimination that are not available for ordinary income.</p>

<p>This piece is a research note on those strategies. It is not tax advice — your specific situation requires the analysis of a qualified tax professional who understands your circumstances. But it is a framework for the conversations you should be having with that professional, and a guide to the strategies they should be considering on your behalf.</p>

<div class="section-divider">• • •</div>

<h2>The Foundation: How Bitcoin Is Taxed</h2>

<p>Before we discuss optimization, we need to establish the baseline. How is Bitcoin actually taxed under current U.S. law?</p>

<p><strong>Capital gains treatment.</strong> Bitcoin held as an investment is a capital asset. Gains on the sale of Bitcoin held for more than one year are taxed at long-term capital gains rates (currently 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on taxable income), plus the 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) for taxpayers above certain income thresholds. Gains on Bitcoin held for one year or less are taxed as short-term capital gains at ordinary income rates (up to 37% federal).</p>

<p>The difference between long-term and short-term rates is substantial. For a family in the highest bracket, the difference is between 23.8% (20% + 3.8% NIIT) and 40.8% (37% + 3.8% NIIT). On a $10 million gain, that's a difference of $1.7 million. Holding period management is therefore the most fundamental tax planning tool for Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>Cost basis.</strong> Your cost basis in Bitcoin is what you paid for it, including any fees. If you acquired Bitcoin at different times and prices — as most long-term holders have — you have multiple "lots," each with its own cost basis and holding period. When you sell, you need to identify which lot you're selling, which determines the gain and the tax rate.</p>

<p><strong>Taxable events.</strong> The following are taxable dispositions of Bitcoin: selling for dollars (or any fiat currency), exchanging for another asset, spending on goods or services, and gifting above the annual exclusion amount (which triggers gift tax reporting, though not necessarily gift tax). Notably, transferring Bitcoin between your own wallets is <em>not</em> a taxable event, nor is purchasing Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting requirements.</strong> Beginning with the 2025 tax year, brokers and exchanges are required to report Bitcoin transactions to the IRS on Form 1099-DA. Self-custodied Bitcoin transactions, however, remain largely self-reported. The IRS has invested heavily in blockchain analytics and has demonstrated the ability to trace on-chain transactions — the days of "the IRS can't see my Bitcoin" are over, if they ever existed.</p>

<h2>Strategy 1: Cost Basis Optimization</h2>

<p>The single most impactful tax strategy for families with large, long-held Bitcoin positions is cost basis optimization — also known as specific identification or "lot selection."</p>

<p>When you sell a portion of your Bitcoin holdings, you don't have to sell on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The IRS allows you to specifically identify which lot you're selling, provided you can adequately identify the specific units at the time of sale and your records support the identification.</p>

<p>This is powerful. Consider a family that acquired Bitcoin over several years:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Lot</th><th>Acquired</th><th>Amount</th><th>Cost Basis</th></tr>
<tr><td>Lot A</td><td>2015</td><td>50 BTC</td><td>$250/BTC</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lot B</td><td>2018</td><td>30 BTC</td><td>$6,500/BTC</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lot C</td><td>2020</td><td>20 BTC</td><td>$9,000/BTC</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lot D</td><td>2022</td><td>25 BTC</td><td>$40,000/BTC</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If this family needs to sell 10 BTC when the price is $100,000, the tax consequences vary dramatically depending on which lot they sell from:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Selling from Lot A:</strong> Gain = $997,500 per BTC → $9,975,000 total gain → ~$2,374,050 in federal tax</li>
<li><strong>Selling from Lot D:</strong> Gain = $60,000 per BTC → $600,000 total gain → ~$142,800 in federal tax</li>
</ul>

<p>Same number of Bitcoin sold. Same sale price. Tax difference: over $2.2 million. Simply by selecting which lot to sell.</p>

<p>The general principle is HIFO — highest in, first out — which minimizes the gain by selling the lots with the highest cost basis first. But the optimal strategy depends on context: if you expect to pass Bitcoin through your estate (receiving a step-up in basis at death), it may be better to sell the high-basis lots now and let the low-basis lots benefit from the step-up later. This is where integration with your <a href="/blog/multi-generational-bitcoin-wealth-estate-planning.html">estate plan</a> becomes critical.</p>

<p>The prerequisite for specific identification is meticulous record-keeping. You need to know the cost basis and acquisition date of every lot, and you need to be able to demonstrate which lot you're selling at the time of sale. If you can't document this, the IRS may default to FIFO — which, for early Bitcoin adopters, produces the worst possible tax outcome.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote">The difference between a well-managed and a poorly-managed Bitcoin tax position can be millions of dollars. The difference is not the strategy — it's the record-keeping.</blockquote>

<h2>Strategy 2: Tax-Loss Harvesting</h2>

<p>Bitcoin's volatility, which creates challenges in so many areas, is an advantage for tax planning. During periods of significant price decline, families can sell Bitcoin at a loss to realize capital losses, which can offset capital gains from other sales or, if losses exceed gains, offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year, with unlimited carryforward.</p>

<p>Here's where Bitcoin offers a significant advantage over traditional securities: as of 2025, Bitcoin is generally not subject to the "wash sale" rule that applies to stocks and securities. The wash sale rule prevents investors from claiming a loss if they repurchase "substantially identical" securities within 30 days. Because the IRS classifies Bitcoin as property rather than a security, this rule has not traditionally applied — meaning you could sell Bitcoin at a loss and immediately repurchase it, locking in the tax loss without changing your economic position.</p>

<p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> This is an evolving area of law. The IRS has shown interest in extending wash sale rules to digital assets, and some tax professionals take a more conservative position. Proposed legislation has attempted to close this gap. Families should monitor this closely and consult with counsel before executing wash sale strategies with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Even if wash sale rules are eventually applied, a 31-day waiting period before repurchase is a manageable constraint for families with long time horizons. The tax benefit of harvesting a large unrealized loss during a significant drawdown can be substantial enough to justify the 31-day price exposure.</p>

<h2>Strategy 3: Charitable Giving</h2>

<p>For families with philanthropic goals, donating appreciated Bitcoin directly to a qualified charity is one of the most tax-efficient giving strategies available.</p>

<p>When you donate Bitcoin that you've held for more than one year to a qualified 501(c)(3) organization, you receive a charitable deduction equal to the fair market value of the Bitcoin at the time of donation — and you pay <em>zero</em> capital gains tax on the appreciation. The charity, as a tax-exempt entity, also pays no tax when it sells the Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Compare this to selling the Bitcoin and donating the cash proceeds:</p>

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Donate Bitcoin Directly</th><th>Sell, Then Donate Cash</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bitcoin value</td><td>$1,000,000</td><td>$1,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost basis</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$50,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Capital gains tax</td><td>$0</td><td>$226,100</td></tr>
<tr><td>Charitable deduction</td><td>$1,000,000</td><td>$773,900</td></tr>
<tr><td>Net tax benefit</td><td>$370,000 (at 37%)</td><td>$286,343</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Donating the Bitcoin directly saves over $83,000 in this example — and the numbers scale linearly. For families with large low-basis Bitcoin positions and active philanthropic programs, this strategy can save millions over a lifetime.</p>

<p>For families who want to maintain their Bitcoin position while achieving the tax benefit, a "donate and repurchase" strategy may be appropriate: donate appreciated Bitcoin to charity, claim the deduction, and use other funds to purchase new Bitcoin at the current market price (which becomes your new, higher cost basis). Because the charitable donation of property is not a "sale," wash sale concerns don't apply.</p>

<h3>Donor-Advised Funds and Charitable Remainder Trusts</h3>

<p>For families that want to time their charitable giving strategically, two vehicles are particularly useful:</p>

<p><strong>Donor-Advised Fund (DAF).</strong> A DAF allows you to make a large charitable contribution of appreciated Bitcoin in a single year — claiming the deduction immediately — and then distribute the funds to specific charities over time. This is useful for "bunching" deductions in high-income years. Several major DAF providers, including Fidelity Charitable and the National Philanthropic Trust, accept Bitcoin donations directly.</p>

<p><strong>Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT).</strong> A CRT is a more complex but potentially more powerful vehicle. You transfer appreciated Bitcoin to the CRT, which sells it (tax-free, as a tax-exempt trust) and invests the proceeds. The trust pays you (or your designated beneficiaries) an income stream for a term of years or for life. At the end of the term, the remainder passes to charity. You receive a partial charitable deduction at the time of funding, you avoid immediate capital gains tax, and you receive income over the trust term. The CRT is particularly interesting for Bitcoin holders who want to diversify out of a concentrated Bitcoin position while deferring the tax impact.</p>

<h2>Strategy 4: Opportunity Zone Investment</h2>

<p>The Qualified Opportunity Zone (QOZ) program, created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, offers significant tax benefits for reinvesting capital gains into designated economically distressed areas. While the program's most generous benefits have sunset (the basis step-ups for investments held 5 and 7 years expired in 2026), the core benefit remains: capital gains invested in a QOZ fund and held for at least 10 years are eligible for permanent exclusion of gains on the QOZ investment itself.</p>

<p>For Bitcoin holders realizing large capital gains, a QOZ investment can serve as a tax-efficient diversification strategy. You sell Bitcoin, realize the gain, invest the gain amount in a qualified opportunity zone fund within 180 days, and the appreciation on the QOZ investment is permanently tax-free after 10 years.</p>

<p>The practical challenge is finding quality QOZ investments. The program was designed to channel capital into distressed communities, and the investment opportunities vary widely in quality. Families considering this strategy should conduct thorough due diligence on the underlying real estate or business investments within the QOZ fund.</p>

<h2>Strategy 5: Entity Structuring</h2>

<p>The entity through which Bitcoin is held can significantly affect its tax treatment. This is an area where the <a href="/blog/building-bitcoin-native-family-office.html">family office structure</a> directly impacts tax outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Individual ownership.</strong> The simplest structure. Bitcoin held by an individual is taxed at individual capital gains rates. The 3.8% NIIT applies above certain income thresholds ($200,000 single, $250,000 married filing jointly). State income taxes apply based on the individual's state of residence.</p>

<p><strong>LLC taxed as a disregarded entity or partnership.</strong> For a single-member LLC, this is tax-transparent — the same as individual ownership. For a multi-member LLC (e.g., a family LLC with multiple family members), partnership taxation allows for flexible allocation of gains and losses among members, subject to substantial economic effect rules. This can be useful for shifting gains to family members in lower tax brackets.</p>

<p><strong>S Corporation.</strong> An S corporation election can be useful if the family office generates significant fee income or management income in addition to Bitcoin capital gains. The S corp structure can help minimize self-employment taxes on that income. However, it adds complexity and has restrictions on the number and type of shareholders.</p>

<p><strong>C Corporation.</strong> Generally not recommended for holding appreciating Bitcoin due to double taxation (corporate tax on gains, plus individual tax on distributions). However, a C corp can be useful in specific situations, such as when the family wants to reinvest gains within the entity at the corporate rate (21%) and defer the second layer of tax indefinitely.</p>

<p><strong>Trust.</strong> Bitcoin held in trust is taxed at trust tax rates, which reach the highest bracket (37%) at just $14,450 of income (2024). This compressed bracket structure makes trusts tax-inefficient for realizing gains unless gains are distributed to beneficiaries and taxed at their (presumably lower) individual rates. The trust document should provide the trustee with the authority to make these distributing elections.</p>

<h2>Strategy 6: State Tax Optimization</h2>

<p>For families with geographic flexibility, state tax optimization is one of the highest-impact strategies available. The difference between the highest and lowest state tax rates on capital gains is enormous:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>State</th><th>Top Capital Gains Rate</th></tr>
<tr><td>California</td><td>13.3%</td></tr>
<tr><td>New York</td><td>10.9% (+ NYC 3.876%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>New Jersey</td><td>10.75%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oregon</td><td>9.9%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Texas</td><td>0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Florida</td><td>0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wyoming</td><td>0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nevada</td><td>0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tennessee</td><td>0%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For a family realizing $10 million in Bitcoin capital gains, the difference between California and Texas is $1.33 million — in a single year. Over a lifetime of strategic Bitcoin dispositions, the cumulative difference can be eight figures.</p>

<p>Changing state domicile is a significant decision with implications beyond taxes. But for families already considering relocation — or for families establishing a new family office and choosing its jurisdiction — the tax implications should be a primary factor. Note that simply establishing a mailing address in a no-income-tax state is insufficient. Each state has its own residency rules, and high-tax states like California and New York are aggressive in auditing departing high-income taxpayers. A genuine change of domicile requires cutting ties comprehensively.</p>

<p>Wyoming deserves special mention for Bitcoin families. In addition to having no state income tax, Wyoming has passed some of the most Bitcoin-friendly legislation in the country, including the Wyoming Digital Asset Act (which classifies Bitcoin as property for UCC purposes), favorable trust law for dynasty trusts, and the Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter that enables state-chartered banks to custody Bitcoin. Families establishing a family office in Wyoming benefit from tax advantages, favorable legal treatment of digital assets, and a regulatory environment that is actively accommodating Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Strategy 7: Bitcoin-Backed Borrowing</h2>

<p>For families that need liquidity but don't want to trigger capital gains by selling Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin holdings is an increasingly viable strategy.</p>

<p>The logic is simple: borrowing is not a taxable event. If you can borrow dollars using your Bitcoin as collateral, you get the liquidity you need without realizing any gain. You continue to hold the Bitcoin (and benefit from any future appreciation), and you pay interest on the loan — which, depending on the use of proceeds, may be deductible.</p>

<p>This is the same "buy, borrow, die" strategy that has been used by wealthy families holding concentrated stock positions for decades. The mechanics are well-established and legally sound. The difference with Bitcoin is the collateral: Bitcoin-backed loans typically require higher collateral ratios (often 200-300% loan-to-value) due to Bitcoin's volatility, and the consequences of a margin call — forced liquidation of Bitcoin, triggering a taxable event — are severe.</p>

<p>Families considering this strategy should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain conservative loan-to-value ratios (30-40% or lower) to minimize margin call risk</li>
<li>Use only a portion of their holdings as collateral, keeping reserves to post additional collateral if needed</li>
<li>Understand the lender's liquidation procedures and triggers</li>
<li>Evaluate the <a href="/blog/bitcoin-custody-solutions-family-offices.html">custody implications</a> — most Bitcoin-backed lending requires transferring Bitcoin to the lender's custody, which introduces counterparty risk</li>
<li>Ensure the interest rate makes economic sense relative to the expected appreciation of the Bitcoin</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
The "buy, borrow, die" strategy is not a loophole. It is a feature of the tax code that has been used by sophisticated taxpayers for generations. Applying it to Bitcoin is a natural extension of established practice.
</blockquote>

<h2>Strategy 8: The Step-Up at Death</h2>

<p>We touched on this in our <a href="/blog/multi-generational-bitcoin-wealth-estate-planning.html">estate planning analysis</a>, but it's worth emphasizing in the tax context: the step-up in cost basis at death is one of the most powerful tax benefits in the entire code, and it is particularly valuable for Bitcoin holders with large unrealized gains.</p>

<p>When Bitcoin passes through an estate, the heir's cost basis is "stepped up" to the fair market value at the date of death. All the unrealized gain accumulated during the decedent's lifetime is permanently eliminated — not deferred, eliminated.</p>

<p>For a family that acquired 100 BTC at $1,000 each ($100,000 total basis) and holds them until the founding generation's death at a value of $500,000 per BTC ($50,000,000 total value), the step-up eliminates $49,900,000 in unrealized gain. At a 23.8% combined federal rate, that's $11,876,200 in capital gains tax that is never paid. Even accounting for potential estate taxes, the step-up provides enormous value.</p>

<p>This is why the interplay between income tax planning and estate tax planning is so important for Bitcoin families. The optimal strategy often involves holding the lowest-basis Bitcoin until death (to maximize the step-up) while using the strategies above — charitable giving, borrowing, selling higher-basis lots first — to meet liquidity needs during life.</p>

<h2>What Would Change This Analysis</h2>

<p>Tax law changes. The strategies outlined here are based on current law, but several proposed changes could significantly alter the landscape:</p>

<p><strong>Elimination of step-up in basis.</strong> President Biden proposed replacing the step-up with carryover basis and taxing unrealized gains at death. This would fundamentally change the "buy, borrow, die" strategy and the estate planning calculus for Bitcoin. The proposal has not been enacted as of this writing, but it recurs in policy discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Wash sale rule extension to digital assets.</strong> If Congress extends wash sale rules to Bitcoin, the tax-loss harvesting strategy becomes more constrained (though not eliminated — a 31-day waiting period is still manageable).</p>

<p><strong>Increase in capital gains rates.</strong> Various proposals would tax long-term capital gains at ordinary income rates for taxpayers above certain thresholds. This would narrow the benefit of holding period management but increase the value of deferral strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Billionaire minimum tax.</strong> Some proposals would impose a minimum tax on unrealized gains for extremely high-net-worth individuals. If enacted, this could affect families with large unrealized Bitcoin positions.</p>

<p>None of these proposals has been enacted. But prudent planning involves monitoring them and having contingency strategies ready. A well-structured <a href="/blog/building-bitcoin-native-family-office.html">family office</a> with competent tax advisors should be reviewing the legislative landscape quarterly and adjusting strategies proactively.</p>

<div class="section-divider">• • •</div>

<h2>Putting It Together</h2>

<p>The optimal tax strategy for a Bitcoin family isn't any single technique — it's the integration of multiple strategies into a coherent plan that aligns with the family's goals, time horizon, and estate structure.</p>

<p>A well-designed Bitcoin tax plan might look like this:</p>

<p><strong>During accumulation years:</strong> Maintain meticulous cost basis records. Harvest tax losses during drawdowns. Establish the entity structure that provides the best long-term tax position.</p>

<p><strong>During holding years:</strong> Borrow against Bitcoin for liquidity needs rather than selling. Donate appreciated Bitcoin to charity for philanthropic goals. Ensure all Bitcoin is held for more than one year before any disposition.</p>

<p><strong>During distribution years:</strong> Sell highest-basis lots first. Realize gains in no-income-tax states if possible. Use QOZ investments for diversification with tax deferral. Time realizations across tax years to manage bracket exposure.</p>

<p><strong>At generational transfer:</strong> Allow lowest-basis Bitcoin to pass through the estate for step-up. Use irrevocable trusts and dynasty trusts to minimize estate tax exposure. Coordinate with the overall <a href="/blog/multi-generational-bitcoin-wealth-estate-planning.html">estate plan</a> to optimize the interplay between income tax and estate tax.</p>

<p>The families that execute this well will retain substantially more of their Bitcoin wealth than those who don't. The difference isn't marginal — it's measured in millions of dollars over a lifetime and tens of millions over multiple generations.</p>

<p>This is why a dedicated <a href="/blog/complete-guide-bitcoin-family-offices.html">family office structure</a> is so valuable for families with significant Bitcoin positions. The tax planning alone — done well, consistently, across decades — more than justifies the overhead of the structure.</p>
