    <span style="color:var(--text-secondary);">Bitcoin Estate Planning for Tech Founders</span>
  </p>

  <p>You spent years building something, managing cap tables, negotiating term sheets, and thinking carefully about dilution, vesting cliffs, and liquidation preferences. You applied rigorous structural thinking to your company. Then you sold — or your company went public — and you converted a substantial portion of those gains into Bitcoin. That decision made sense. Bitcoin is the exit from the system you were always playing inside.</p>

  <p>But here is the problem: most tech founders apply zero of that structural rigor to what happens next. The Bitcoin sits in a hardware wallet, or at an exchange, with no trust structure, no estate plan, and no clear mechanism for what happens if you die tomorrow. The same precision that built your company is absent from the plan to preserve what it created.</p>

  <p>This is fixable. And the tax and estate planning opportunities available to Bitcoin holders — particularly founders with large, concentrated positions and a long time horizon — are more favorable than most people realize.</p>

  <h2>The Basis Step-Up: Your Heirs' Most Valuable Tax Event</h2>

  <p>Under current U.S. tax law, when you die holding appreciated assets, your heirs receive those assets at a <strong>stepped-up cost basis</strong> equal to the fair market value at your date of death. If you bought Bitcoin at $20,000 and it is worth $500,000 when you die, your heir inherits at a $500,000 basis. Every dollar of gain that accumulated during your lifetime is permanently extinguished — never subject to capital gains tax.</p>

  <p>For a tech founder who converted significant equity gains into Bitcoin, this is potentially the most valuable tax event in your entire financial life — and it happens automatically, without any action required, if the Bitcoin is held correctly at death.</p>

  <p>The critical phrase is "held correctly." Bitcoin held directly in your name, or in a revocable living trust, will receive the step-up. Bitcoin transferred to an irrevocable trust before death — such as a dynasty trust funded with your GST exemption — will <em>not</em> receive the step-up, because those assets are no longer in your taxable estate. Whether to prioritize the step-up or the estate tax exclusion requires careful modeling of your specific position. For founders with very large Bitcoin positions and meaningful estate tax exposure, the two strategies may be applied to different tranches of your holdings.</p>

  <div class="pull-quote">The step-up in basis at death is not a loophole. It is the law. For a Bitcoin holder with decades of unrealized gains, structuring around it is one of the highest-value planning opportunities available.</div>

  <h2>Wash Sale Rules Do Not Apply to Bitcoin — Use That</h2>

  <p>In traditional securities markets, the wash sale rule prevents you from claiming a tax loss if you sell a stock and buy substantially identical securities within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule significantly limits tax-loss harvesting strategies for equity investors.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin is classified as property — not a security — under current IRS guidance. The wash sale rules do not apply. This means you can sell Bitcoin at a loss, immediately repurchase the same amount, and still claim the capital loss for tax purposes — resetting your cost basis in the process.</p>

  <p>For a founder with a large Bitcoin position acquired at various price points, this creates meaningful tax-loss harvesting opportunities during market downturns. You can harvest losses against ordinary income (up to $3,000 per year) or against capital gains from other sources — including the equity gains that preceded your Bitcoin conversion — while maintaining your full Bitcoin position. The strategy is not complex; it simply requires tracking your lot-level basis and acting during periods of Bitcoin price decline.</p>

  <p>Note: Congress has proposed extending wash sale rules to digital assets in multiple legislative sessions. This window may close. If harvesting is part of your strategy, execute it while the law remains favorable.</p>

  <h2>The 83(b) Concept Translates to Bitcoin — Even Though the Rule Does Not</h2>

  <p>Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code allows employees and founders who receive restricted equity to elect to pay tax on the value at grant rather than at vesting. The strategy works because it locks in a low basis early — if the equity appreciates, all subsequent gains are taxed at long-term capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates.</p>

  <p>The 83(b) election does not apply to Bitcoin — you cannot receive Bitcoin as restricted property in the same way you receive restricted stock. But the underlying principle translates directly: <strong>locking in your basis at a low price point is structurally valuable</strong>.</p>

  <p>When you convert equity gains into Bitcoin, your basis is set at the price you paid — typically at a market high if you were converting meaningful liquidity event proceeds. Over time, as Bitcoin appreciates, the embedded gain grows. The equivalent of "83(b) thinking" for Bitcoin is acting early: funding trusts, making gifts to family members, or establishing other structures while your Bitcoin position's value is lower, so that future appreciation inures to the trust or recipient rather than your taxable estate. Founders who understand the 83(b) concept intuitively grasp this structure immediately.</p>

  <h2>Delaware and Wyoming Trust Structures for Asset Protection</h2>

  <p>Most founders are familiar with Delaware as the default jurisdiction for corporate formation. For trust structures, both Delaware and Wyoming offer favorable frameworks — but for somewhat different reasons.</p>

  <p><strong>Delaware</strong> has one of the most sophisticated trust law frameworks in the country: dynasty trust provisions (perpetual trusts), directed trust statutes (allowing separation of investment and administrative functions), and strong asset protection trust legislation that allows self-settled trusts under certain conditions. Delaware corporate trustees are experienced with complex assets and multi-generational mandates.</p>

  <p><strong>Wyoming</strong> has emerged as the leading jurisdiction for Bitcoin-specific trust structures. Wyoming has enacted specific digital asset legislation providing clarity on virtual currency custody in trust contexts. It has abolished the rule against perpetuities entirely (allowing perpetual dynasty trusts), has favorable directed trust statutes, and its trust companies are increasingly Bitcoin-native. For founders with a strong Bitcoin-only thesis, Wyoming trust structures often offer the cleanest alignment between the trust's governing law and the asset being held.</p>

  <p>The practical structure for many founders is an LLC — typically a Wyoming or Delaware LLC — that holds the Bitcoin. The LLC membership interests are then held in a trust. This layered structure provides flexibility: the trust governs succession and estate planning, while the LLC provides liability protection and can specify Bitcoin custody protocols in its operating agreement. The LLC operating agreement can define multisignature key management, hardware wallet procedures, and what happens to access credentials when members change.</p>

  <h2>The Concentration Problem — and Why You Should Keep It</h2>

  <p>Standard financial planning advice would flag your situation as a concentration risk problem. You built a company, converted significant equity into a single asset, and now have a large percentage of your net worth in Bitcoin. Every traditional wealth manager's playbook says to diversify.</p>

  <p>That advice misunderstands your thesis. You hold Bitcoin in concentration because you believe it is the hardest money ever created — a fixed-supply, censorship-resistant, non-sovereign store of value that no government can inflate away. Diversifying into a basket of other assets dilutes that thesis without eliminating the underlying monetary risk you converted out of. You did not convert equity into Bitcoin to then dilute back into the system you exited.</p>

  <p>Concentration in Bitcoin is intentional. But it does require planning — specifically around three questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Do you have sufficient non-Bitcoin liquidity to cover living expenses, tax obligations, and emergencies without selling Bitcoin? If not, your estate plan needs to account for this — including giving your estate or trust executor the ability to manage Bitcoin custody and execute sales without triggering delays or disputes.</li>
    <li><strong>Key-person risk:</strong> Are you the only person who knows how to access your Bitcoin? If you were incapacitated tomorrow, could your family recover it? Most founders — who are comfortable with technology — inadvertently create a catastrophic key-person risk for their own families. Your estate plan must address custody architecture explicitly.</li>
    <li><strong>Gift and transfer strategy:</strong> Bitcoin concentration creates large embedded gains. A systematic gifting program — using the annual gift tax exclusion ($18,000 per recipient per year in 2025), or funding an irrevocable trust with a portion of your position — can reduce your taxable estate over time while keeping the bulk of your Bitcoin intact.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="pull-quote">Concentration in Bitcoin is a thesis, not a mistake. But an intentional thesis requires an intentional structure. The planning is not about reducing your Bitcoin — it is about ensuring that what you hold reaches the next generation intact.</div>

  <h2>The Estate Tax Cliff — Act Before the Exemption Shrinks</h2>

  <p>The federal estate tax exemption is currently $13.99 million per individual (2025). For a married couple, that is nearly $28 million that can pass estate-tax-free at death. For founders with significant Bitcoin positions, this exemption may be sufficient to eliminate estate tax exposure entirely.</p>

  <p>However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions that doubled the exemption are scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025 — reverting to approximately $7 million per individual (indexed for inflation). Unless Congress acts, a founder with a $20 million Bitcoin position could face a $5.2 million estate tax bill that does not exist under current law. The window to fund irrevocable trusts with the elevated exemption is closing.</p>

  <p>Founders who act now — funding dynasty trusts or spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs) while the exemption is elevated — can lock in the current law for assets transferred before the sunset. Assets transferred to an irrevocable trust are removed from the taxable estate even if the exemption later declines. This is the most time-sensitive planning opportunity available to founders in 2025.</p>

  <h2>What Your Estate Plan Should Actually Cover</h2>

  <p>For a tech founder with significant Bitcoin holdings, a complete estate plan addresses the following layers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revocable living trust:</strong> Holds all non-Bitcoin and non-trust assets; provides probate avoidance and incapacity planning; names a successor trustee with specific authority over Bitcoin custody.</li>
    <li><strong>Irrevocable trust (dynasty trust or SLAT):</strong> Funded with a portion of Bitcoin to remove appreciation from the taxable estate, ideally using the elevated exemption before any sunset.</li>
    <li><strong>LLC holding structure:</strong> Wyoming or Delaware LLC holds the Bitcoin; operating agreement specifies custody architecture, key management procedures, and succession protocols.</li>
    <li><strong>Durable power of attorney:</strong> Gives a trusted agent authority over digital assets during incapacity — explicitly covering Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, which many standard POAs do not address.</li>
    <li><strong>Custody documentation:</strong> A sealed, separately stored document (not in the trust itself) describing how to access the Bitcoin — hardware wallet locations, seed phrase storage, multisig configuration. This document is as important as any legal instrument.</li>
    <li><strong>Letter of instruction to heirs:</strong> A plain-language explanation of your Bitcoin philosophy, holdings structure, and wishes — written for a family member who may not share your technical background.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The same discipline that built your cap table should govern your estate structure. The stakes are the same — and in some ways higher, because there is no second round of funding if the plan fails.</p>
